This page contains my impressions of many IEMs that I've had a chance to try. Some of these IEMs were subjected to some A/B tests. Because I have not spent as much time with them as IEMs in [my collection](/collection.md), you should treat these impressions with a grain of salt.

# Dunu SA6
- It’s beautiful! Crystal clear and chock full of BA drivers inside.
- Excellent accessory, but the cable is humongous. Why would you supply such a thick cable for such small and nimble IEM?
- It locks into my ears very well and completely seal them off against the sound of a hifi system running in the background. I can see why this is a professional monitoring tool.
- The sound is clear and detailed. The degree of detail this IEM extract is in the ballpark with the Andromeda 2020, from memory.
- Elements of the mix are not push apart from each other to create separation like Final A4000/A8000. However you can follow each one easily, even the ones far left and far right of the stereo field.
- Smooth tuning. Very comfortable sound, just like many in the 64 audio line up, the kind of sound that you can sit back and listen for hours with getting tired.
- Drawbacks: does not have a strong sense of layering of sound (elements layering from closer to further away). This is the only thing that I dislike. If I can run this one through my detailed A/B tests against benchmarks , I suspect it would rate very high.

# Dunu Zen Pro
- It’s tiny but well built. Much smaller than what I imagined.
- Beautiful, soft cable.
- Out of the box, I can hear that this is an energetic sound. Not a smooth soft tuning like SA6 but the kind of sound that raises your energy level.
- Bass and drum sound excellent on this one. It has the “slam” with a rumbling decay that I can feel in my throat, so I suspect the bass extends pretty low.
- Elements of the mix are decently separated.
- Details are okay too. Not outstanding like SA6, but perhaps because the showroom was a bit noisy.
- Top-end (ultra high frequency or “air”) is there, but not quite as much as I expected. Again, perhaps due to the noisy showroom.
- Drawback: again, layering. And also the not so extravagant detail and top end. It’s still competitive against things like Vega and Dorado, but Andromeda is looming ahead at only AUD$200 more, so I’m not sure I want to add Zen Pro to my collection as much as SA6.

# Dunu EST112
- Custom-looking IEM, made out of a chunk of metal. Pretty cool.
- Nice cable and accessories, as expected.
- The sound is alright. Nothing jumps out to be outstanding or exciting to be geeking about to me.
- I do expect those EST drivers do something special, but I couldn’t hear that something. Perhaps due to noisy showroom.
- I personally would get SA6.

# Fiio FA7s
- FA7s looks like FD5 but with a different face plate. 
- However, Fiio has slightly tweaked the angle of the nozzle, making FA7s sit flush against the concha of my ear. Very comfortable.
- Warm sound, yet percussion instruments sound firm and "fast".
- FA7s sound more detailed than FD5 and way above FH3.
- Due to the strange ear-gain tuning, the stereo imaging is uncanny on this IEM. The stage is pushed against my face and feels "squeeze" in some how. This is a dealbreaker for me.

# Impressions and thoughts on some TOTL from CFA and 64 Audio
Encounter of TOTL: I have a chance to spend several hours A/B tests my collection against CFA Dorado, Andromeda 2020, Ara, and 64 Audio U6t, U12t, and Tia Fourte. Here are some observations and thoughts for fun:
- Higher price does not necessarily means better sound quality. Think of IEM as a character creation in an RPG. Higher price is like rolling more dice to get more attribute points. However, there is no guarantee that you will actually have more points nor those points would go to the attributes that you actually care about.
- However, you have higher chance of finding outstanding IEMs that suit you in higher price bracket.
- You have no idea what you miss in audio gear, unless you hear the deficit yourself. For example, Andromeda 2020 reveals some midrange detail in familiar test tracks that I have no idea my Blessing 2 and A4000 have been missing. Reviewers can sing praises about Andro, but I would not "get" it until I hear it.
- IEMs do not have to sound loud and thin to reveal detail. Many TOTL are warm, comfortable, yet very revealing (particularly Andro and U12t)
- There are more than detail and clarity. Most 64 audio IEMs, and even Andro to a certain degree, have dynamic contrast: loud sound are louder, silence are more quiet, and the sense of "air" and reverb is apparent. Only a few in my collection can give that dynamic contrast.
- There is a physical limitation on soundstage of IEMs. All of the TOTL, especially Andro and Fourte, are well known for soundstage. However, they are not much different from each other and no larger than A4000, which also uses a bunch of tuning tricks for soundstage. And good speakers in a good room murder all of them.
