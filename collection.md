# My favourite / daily drivers
**Final Audio A4000:** extremely transparent and engaging. Trade blows with kilobucks in technicality and soundstage easily (I did A/B tests). However, it has a thin sound and can become tiresome after several hours of listening.
 
**Final Audio E3000:** when I first started, I hated this IEM because it does not have "neutral and mature tuning like Moondrop". Nowadays, it is my favourite: very warm and smooth, yet detailed and resolving if you pay attention. Its warmth reminds me of some 64 audio pairs somehow.

# Respect but don't daily drive

**Blessing 2:** very clear, but not engaging somehow, even after EQ to Dusk target. If B2 is a screen, it's the one with low contrast: no pure white, no pure black, just grey-ish. Another problem is its mediocre stereo imaging ability.

**ER2SE:** depending on the insertion depth, you either have insane detail with no soundstage, or average soundstage with meh detail. Isolation is top-notch, though. *Edit: I found that spin-fit two-flange tips are perfect for these IEMs, giving them soundstage without messing up their treble response. I'm still not a fan of the tuning.*

**Dunu Titan S:** It's great. I take it out once in a while, but I prefer my Final Audio pair.

**Fiio FD5:** used to me by favourite. However, the Final Audio pair ruined FD5 for me by revealing how unrefined the masked the tuning of FD5 is. Still, FD5's midbass is unbeatable in my collection.

# Not really my cup of tea

**Fiio FH3:** my first "expensive" IEM. I used to fight tooth and nail with anyone who thinks FH3 is not so great. And then other IEMs show me FH3's weaknesses, and I cannot unhear them.

**Moondrop Aria:** smooth tuning, but note attacks are soft and fuzzy. It also has the grey-ish sound of Blessing 2. Still, Aria is still a benchmark against which I review other IEMs, due to how natural it sounds.

**KZ ZSN Pro X:** members on r/HeadphoneAdvice keep asking for upgrade path from this one, so I got one to try. Review is up on this sub.

**Airpods Pro:** It's actual decent. More or less the same problem with Aria: soft, fuzzy, and not very contrasty. The convenience is excellent, though.

**$15 supermarket IEM:** if you think KZ is bad, try this one. I bought this to give me an idea how bad an IEM can be.

**Earpods:** Not that bad. Better than the supermarket IEM.
