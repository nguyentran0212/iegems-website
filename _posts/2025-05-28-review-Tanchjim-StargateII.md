Can you really improve on the venerable Apple Dongle? Not those bulky USB stick DACs that guzzle your phone’s battery and weigh a tonne. I’m talking about something just as small, light, and energy-efficient as the Apple Dongle—but better. Tanchjim reckons they’ve cracked it with the Stargate II. Let’s take a look.

Preambles
===
- In this review, I use the term "source" to denote a DAC+amp combo for brevity and convenience. 
- Sources do not make sounds. Therefore, when I say sources "sound" a certain way, I talk about the change they make to my IEMs and earphones. 
- I want my music to be crisp, clear, well-separated and form a 3D soundstage around my head. Sources that intensify those characteristics of my IEMs are considered "better". 
- The unit used for this review was a sample provided by Hifigo (Thank you!). The unit is retailed for $37.99 and can be found on [Hifigo Web Store (non-affiliated link)](https://hifigo.com/collections/tanchjim/products/tanchjim-stargate2).

General Information 
===

The Tanchjim Stargate II is a lightweight USB Type-C digital-to-analog converter (DAC) dongle that feels like a souped-up version of the humble “Apple Dongle.” Its electronics nestle inside an aluminium chassis that doubles as the USB-C male plug, while the 3.5mm female connector sits separately, linked by a braided, insulated copper wire.  
At the heart of the Stargate II lies a Cirrus Logic CS43131 DAC chip, paired with a proprietary Tanchjim control chip that unlocks an 8-band parametric equalizer (PEQ). To fiddle with this EQ, you’ll need a companion app on your phone—no surprises there.  

Specs-wise, it’s all rather stellar, as one would expected form a modern IC-based DAC: signal-to-noise ratio exceeding 127 dB, dynamic range around 127.5 dB, total harmonic distortion hovering near 0.0002%, crosstalk at −72 dB into a 32 Ω load, and a noise floor down at an almost laughably low 1.1 μV RMS. The power output is modest—82mW at 16Ω and 75mW at 32Ω—but still enough to blow your ears out with most IEMs. It handles PCM up to 32-bit/384kHz and native DSD decoding up to DSD256, ticking all the right boxes on paper. 

Oh, and like the Apple Dongle it’s loosely inspired by, the Stargate II supports mic input, so gaming headsets are fair game. This also doubles as a quirky bonus: you can use it as a soundcard to measure the frequency response of other IEMs. Practical and clever, if not exactly earth-shattering. 

Usage experience
===

Using the Stargate II is a bit like brewing a cup of instant coffee. No need for fancy glassware or Barista-level skills—just straightforward, no-nonsense utility. It’s not the sort of high-maintenance audiophile bauble you treat like your favourite vintage scotch; instead, it’s the reliable, unpretentious companion you keep plugged in as you shuffle through emails with some background music warming the office air. Treating it like a utility rather than an objet d’art, I put it through the daily grind for over a month or so. Here’s how that went.

Let’s start with my usual gripe about these tiny dongles: the volume. Oh no, it’s rarely that they’re too quiet. Quite the opposite. Most are absurdly loud, often unusable with sensitive IEMs even at their lowest setting. Stargate II manages to sidestep this particular nuisance, at least partially. Hooked up to my laptop and using the HiBy Yacht10—a rather sensitive pair of IEMs—I had to keep the volume dialed down to the absolute minimum just to keep the music background-friendly. In truth, it was still never quite quiet enough for my tastes. The situation improves significantly when pairing the Stargate II with my Android phone (CMF Phone 1), where a comfortable listening level falls around the 50% mark, leaving ample wiggle room on both ends of the volume scale.

Annoyance of 3.5mm connector in the age of 4.4mm. 

**Comparisons**: Listening to 33 Max Verstappen by Carte Blanq and Maxx Power mostly. Yeah, you can say I'm a fan of the Mad Max. 

- **L&P W4**: W4 sounds simply more full, whilst Stargate II sounds a bit tinny. It's not that Stargate II has not bass impact. No, it's surprisingly quite competent next to W4. It's more a tonal problem, as if the lower midrange is just weaker on Stargate II, so the upper midrange is more highlighted, giving voices a kinda thin and nasally tone and make voices stand out quite a bit. Meanwhile, the muscular lower pitched elements in the mix are not quite brought forward as much with Stargate II as with W4. When I put on the "audiophile" glasses, I would say the difference is rather large that maintains the effect on my enjoyment of the music even when I'm not putting on my "critical listening" hat. However, in the grand scheme, it's rather surprising how close Stargate II get to W4, from a cursory listening. It has bass (like, the deep, bass impact), and it has the soundstage as well, two areas where larger and more bulky amplifiers tend to dominate.
- **HiBy R3II (Micro DAP)**: Impressively, the R3II keeps up in terms of soundstage spaciousness. However, it falls short in bass power, control, and transient response. The subbass rumbles feel weaker, mushier, and less textured. The less incisive transients of the R3II nearly erase the holographic and 3D impression in the AFUL Cantor.

- **HiBy FD5 (Desktop-class DAC and amplifier)**: Tested with FD5 on low gain and class A amplifier, I found the FD5 and R6 Pro Max trade blows in soundstage size. FD5's stage is slightly larger and more open. The perceived bass power is similar, but FD5 lacks the incisiveness of transients, resulting in a less pitch black background and more "analog" sounding presentation.

- **iBasso DX300 (Flagship-class DAP)**: With medium gain and no oversampling, the DX300 trades blows with the R6 Pro Max in soundstage size. It also matches in bass power, control, and detail retrieval. Where the R6 Pro Max shines is in dynamics and the pitch black background, delivering a more exciting listening experience.


Concluding Remarks

Back to the question posed at the beginning of this article: what makes a DAP good? To me, a DAP is "good" when it has long battery, when its software does not get in the way of music enjoyment, and when its sound is "good enough." Generally, "good enough" means a DAP does not get in the way of my IEM too much compared to the DAC and amplifier sitting at my desk. However, once in a while, I come across a portable devices that make noticeable differences, to lift my IEM just a step beyond what the sound I am familiar with. After three months of testing, I am confident to put R6 Pro Max in this group of rare devices. I like how this DAP makes my familiar IEMs a bit more lively, a bit more impressive. The larger battery, better screen, and strong suite of DSP software complete the package, making a box of musical joy. 

What I like about this device: 

- Design, machining, and build quality
- The screen
- The battery, especially the standby and off time
- The software suite, especially the new PEQ software
- The sense of dynamic
- Pitch black background leading to a holographic soundstage
- Bass power and control
- Detail retrieval

What could be improved:

- Latency in USB DAC mode
- Get warm when playing music
- The size and weight could be a concern for some users
- Moving to Snapdragon Gen 3 or Elite next time?
