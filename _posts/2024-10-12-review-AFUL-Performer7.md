In 2022, which feels like an eon ago in the fast moving world of IEMs, the original Performer5 was released and brought the mysterious IEM manufacturer AFUL into the limelight. Three years and a steady supply of memorable releases later, AFUL is no longer a stranger but a well-known and admired IEM R&D powerhouse within portable audio communities. And now, three years, they finally return to revamp and update their first release, the beginning of their epoch. Today, we will take a look at the brand new Performer5+2 and catch a glimpse of a new era.

- What I look for in an IEM is **immersion.** I want to feel the orchestra around my head, track individual instruments, and hear all of their textures and details. I'm not picky about tonality, as long as it does not make the orchestra, violin, cellos, and pianos sound wrong.
- I rate IEMs within with a consistent scale from **1 (Poor) to 3 (Good) to 5 (Outstanding)**. An overall ranking of 3/5 or above is considered positive. 
- Ranking list and measurement database are on [my IEM review blog](https://iegems.nk-tran.com/).
- The terminology for subjective impressions in this review is based on the Audio Wheel for reproduced sound defined in the technical report [ITU-R BS.2399-0](https://www.itu.int/pub/R-REP-BS.2399)
- **This review is based on a review sample from AFUL, arranged by Hifigo (Thank you!).** I have no affiliation with or financial interest in AFUL and Hifigo.

General Information
===

First, let's talk about the naming situation of this IEM, and the fact that it has multiple names. Officially, this IEM is named Performer5+2, which indicates that it is a continuation of the original Performer5 and carries two additional drivers, namely a dynamic driver (DD) and a micro planar driver. Because the original Performer5 had 5 drivers, 1DD + 4 Balanced Armature (BA) drivers, adding two drivers bring the total number of drivers to 7, which means Performer5+2 is technically "Performer7". Moreover, because Performer5+2 actually carries 2DD, 4BA, and 1 micro planar driver, technically, it should be called "Performer2+4+1." For the sake of brevity, in this article, I would use the abbreviation "P7" to talk about Performer5+2. Many in the community also adopted the P7 abbreviation, so I hope you won't be confused when seeing P7 across forums.

Now that we are clear about the naming situation, let's talk about the technology inside P7. Let's first talk about the returning technologies from previous AFUL releases before talking about the new ones. The high-precision 3D printed tube structures and the "RLC 3D frequency division" crossover circuits lay a foundation by allowing tuners fine-grained control over the response of each set of driver within P7. This time, AFUL utilises a **4-way crossover** with 4 frequency bands: 10Hz-500Hz, 500Hz-3kHz, 3kHz-12kHz, and 12kHz-35kHz. The high-damping air-pressure balance system started all the way from P5, which handles both pressure release and improving the bass quality, also makes a return with P7. 

P7 brings two new technologies to the entire AFUL IEM family. The first one is the use of two 6mm DD for bass. It is unknown if a true isobaric design is utilised here. It's pretty much speculation at this moment, but it seems that the choice of two smaller DD rather than a large DD allows for a more agile transient response in the bass region without sacrificing the perceived power, leading to a rather excellent bass response and dynamic. I will discuss further in the listening impression. 

The second new technology of P7 is the so-called "micro planar" driver. Unlike the prevalent 14mm drivers and the newer 6mm drivers, which have circular diaphragms and operate somewhat like miniaturized Audeze or Hifiman headphone drivers, the micro planar driver used by P7 is more akin to traditional BA drivers. In fact, the size of the driver itself is nearly identical to that of Knowles 30095, which is quite popular, both the genuine and the clone version. There are a few other IEMs using this type micro planar drivers, including Astell & Kern Zero1 and Zero2. Unfortunately, not much is known about these drivers. Still, the upper treble range where P7 utilises these drivers sounds pretty great.

Non-sound Aspects

**Packaging and accessories** P7 comes in the usual packaging of AFUL: thick cardboard box with outer sleeve, custom foam cutout inserts to hold the content. Accessories have been upgraded comparing to P5. The plastic puck case to carry the IEM is now slightly flatter to increase the storage space within. The 8-wire IEM cable is way softer and easier to handle than the older cable. The types of included ear tips were also increased from 2 to 3. Each type has a different degree of hardness, and all of them provides the optimal length for fit P7 at the appropriate depth within the ear canal. 

**Earpieces design** Very similar. The earpieces of P7 are on the smaller end of the spectrum. They are well contoured with no sharp edge. The nozzles of P7 are also smaller and longer than average.

**Fit, comfort and isolation** Due to the smaller design, I find P7 to be very comfortable, even in long listening session that lasts hours. I did not experience pressure build up or driver flex in my tests, indicating that the pressure release mechanism works well. Interestingly, despite the pressure release, the isolation of P7 is rather strong, to the point that I regularly use P7 as earplugs for commute. 

**Ear tips recommendation:** IEMs with stronger treble extension like most AFUL IEMs generally require a deeper fit. I would not recommend any ear tips that further extend the length of the nozzles and push the earpieces away from ear canal, such as Pentaconn Coreir ear tips. I did not find the need to swap ear tips with P7 and stick with the stock medium ear tips for most of my tests.

The subjective impression is captured using the lexicon in the Sound Wheel below. I'll clarify the terminology as I use them. If you want to see more details of the lexicon and related reference, please have a look at the technical report [ITU-R BS.2399-0](https://www.itu.int/pub/R-REP-BS.2399).

**Timbre:** *It is helpful to think of an IEM as a filter that highlights or subdues different parts of the incoming audio signal. This effect can be measured objectively by the squiggly lines below, called Frequency Response (FR) graphs, which measure how loud an IEM is at different frequencies from 20Hz (bass) to 20kHz (upper treble). Subjectivity is how your ears and brain interpret the effect of that filter on your music and decide whether it is "enjoyable." There are some "rules of thumb" when it comes to tonality, but most interesting IEMs usually bend the rules masterfully.*

*Figure shows the frequency response of Performer 7 against the Harman in-ear target. Measurements were done with an IEC-711-compliant coupler and might only be compared with other measurements from this same coupler. Above 8kHz, the measurement likely does not match the response at the ear drum. Visit my [graph database](https://nk-tran.com/iegems-graphtool/) for more comparisons.*

I would describe the tonality of P7 as **"mild V-shape"**. It has a boosted bass, slightly lifted lower midrange, and a certain degree of emphasis in the treble. However, the boosted frequencies are not overly exaggerated, thus keeping the overall tonality and the perceived "contrast" of P7's presentation at a level that I consider neutral. As a result, all recordings across genres sound very balanced and natural with P7. It does not lack bass, yet does not make bass overshadow other parts of the mix. It does make treble stand out, without making treble too pronounced and fatiguing. I did not detect any problem in how P7 balances different sections in a large orchestra, different voices in a piano solo, nor different voices and instruments within a rock band. If I were to really nitpick, I would say the lower voices in piano solos sound a smidgen louder than how they should be. 

Where P7 truly shines is how it presents the midrange. Thanks to the subtle lift in the lower midrange and the impeccable balance against the upper midrange, the midrange of P7 has a subtle warmth to make voices and instruments more pleasing (or dare I say... "musical"), I'm particularly impressed by how P7 handles


*How does the midrange of P7 handle vocals? (Sample tracks: [Dreamland Express by John Denver](https://youtu.be/6pqfoBUTFdk?si=oxKzIDQ42CfgCyuf), [Kiwi wa Boku ni Niteiru by See-Saw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6BkF23UPbM))*

*How does P7 handle sibilant recordings? (Sample tracks: [Shivers by Ed Sheeran](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2_Lrg6rRks))*

*How does P7 reproduce strings and orchestra? (Sample tracks: [Now We Are Free by 2CELLOS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74CYIdYoQ5w), [Ciaccona from Bach's Violin Partita No.2 in D Minor, performed by Kavakos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtA5DbswJ90), [Synchro BOM-BA-YE by Tokyo Kosei Wind Orchestra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lwPiXnOGZ4))*


**Percussion, Bass, and perceived dynamic:** *In this section, my focus is the not just the bass, but rather the sense of dynamic of an IEM. Can it convey the sense of beat and rhythm? Can it reproduce transients, the fast and large jump of loudness in the music? Simply put, is this IEM toe-tapping? Creating this energy requires all parts of the frequency spectrum working together: treble energy around 4-6kHz conveys snappy attacks of stick hitting percussive instruments at the beginning of a beat, bass energy around 150Hz conveys the punchy sensation of the beat itself, whilst the subbass energy below 60Hz creates the physical rumble sensation that convey power and atmosphere. Weak treble response dulls the attacks. Weak bass makes beats hollow. Too much bass makes bassline blurry and dulls the sense of rhythm. Thus, "dynamic IEM" is a balancing art.*

Overview of the bass and dynamic using the soundwheel terminology:
- Attack
- Bass precision
- Punch
- Powerful

*How does P7 convey "epic" bass lines? (Sample tracks: [Heart of Courage (Live) by Two Steps From Hell](https://youtu.be/1Qvp-w24z1U?si=44knlswJcyf7Ez2z), [A Reckoning in Blood from The Ghost of Tsushima OST](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaBMXXo-vdU))*

*How does P7 handle a drum kit and bass guitar? (Sample tracks: [Playing God by Polyphia](https://youtu.be/Z5NoQg8LdDk?si=eEQGevLZb1SE-FVY))*

*In conclusion, is P7 ... toe-tapping?*


**Resolution:** *To me, "resolution" can be broken down into three components: (1) Sharpness, incisiveness, or "definition" of note attacks (see the figure below). (2) The separation of instruments and vocals, especially when they overlap on the soundstage. (3) The texture and details in the decay side of the notes. The first two give music clarity and make it easy to track individual elements of a mix. The last provides music details and nuances. Whilst IEMs can "force" clarity by boosting treble to unnatural level, it might still lack resolution as it cannot "peel apart" complex tracks with overlapping instruments*

Describe the resolution using the terminology from soundwheel:
- Clean
- Presence
- Clarity
- Detailed
- Natural

*Can P7 handle complex, overlapping recordings? (Sample tracks: [ABC feat. Sophia Black by Polyphia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mtd24QIBJ5Y))*

*Can P7 handle recordings with congested lower frequencies? (Sample tracks: [Now We Are Free performed by 2CELLOS](https://youtu.be/74CYIdYoQ5w?si=QcKrIFSifRzBHt2i))*

*How does P7 convey micro details? (Sample tracks: [Ciaccona from Bach's Violin Partita No. 2 in D Minor, performed by Kavakos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtA5DbswJ90))*

*On the scale from fair (Moondrop Aria) to good (Moondrop Blessing 2) to great (CFA Andromeda 2020) to outstanding (AFUL Cantor), how resolving is P7?*


**Stereo imaging and soundstage:** *Stereo imaging or "soundstage" is a psychoacoustic illusion that different recording elements appear at various locations inside and around your head. Your brain creates based on the cues in the recording, which are enhanced or diminushed by your IEMs, your DAC, and your amplifier. In rare cases, with some specific songs, some IEMs can trick you into thinking that the sound comes from the environment (a.k.a., "holographic")*

Overview of the soundstage and imaging capability using the soundwheel terminology.:
- Spatial extent: depth, width, envelopment
- Localiation: distance, internality, localisability
- Reverberation

*How does P7 position instruments in a complex, 3D-sounding recording? (Sample tracks: [Original Sound Effect Track - Memory from Gundam Seed Destiny OST album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhJWAWqExQs))*

*How does P7 convey a sense of space in spacious recordings? (Sample tracks: [Shadow of Baar Dau](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXcLuLQ_5oM))*

*How does P7 handles sound positioning in FPS games?*

*On the scale from good (Blessing 2) to great (CFA Andromeda 2020) to outstanding (AFUL Cantor), how good is the stereo imaging and soundstage of P7?*
