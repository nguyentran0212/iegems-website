- What I look for in an IEM is **immersion.** I want to feel the orchestra around my head, track individual instruments, and hear all of their textures and details. I'm not picky about tonality, as long as it is not make the orchestra, violin, cellos, and pianos sound wrong.
- I rate IEMs within with a consistent scale from **1 (Poor) to 3 (Good) to 5 (Outstanding)**. An overall ranking of 3/5 or above is considered positive. 
- Ranking list and measurement database are on [my IEM review blog](https://iegems.nk-tran.com/).
- The terminology for subjective impressions in this review is based on the Audio Wheel for reproduced sound defined in the technical report [ITU-R BS.2399-0](https://www.itu.int/pub/R-REP-BS.2399)
- **This review is possible thanks to the Australian tour arranged by Minidisc and @Damz87 (Thank you!)**. I have no affiliation with or financial interest in Minidisc. 
- The unit retails for A$549 at the time this review was published. Unaffiliated link: [Minidisc online store](https://www.minidisc.com.au/dita-audio-project-m)

The subjective impression is captured using the lexicon in the Sound Wheel below. I'll clarify the terminology as I use them. If you want to see more details of the lexicon and related reference, please have a look at the technical report [ITU-R BS.2399-0](https://www.itu.int/pub/R-REP-BS.2399).

**Timbre:** *Figure shows the frequency response of Project M against the Harman in-ear target. Measurements were done with an IEC-711-compliant coupler and might only be compared with other measurements from this same coupler. Above 8kHz, the measurement likely does not match the response at the ear drum. Visit my [graph database](https://nk-tran.com/iegems-graphtool/) for more comparisons.*

Overview of the timbre and tonal balance, with reference to the frequency response. Use the terminology of sound wheel.
- Timbral balance: dark-bright, full, homogeneous
- Midrange: nasal? canny? strength?
- Treble: brilliance, tinny? treble strength?
- Bass: bass strength? depth? boomy? boxy?


**Bass and perceived dynamic:**

Overview of the bass and dynamic using the soundwheel terminology:
- Attack
- Bass precision
- Punch
- Powerful

The graph shows exactly where Project M goes wrong with its tuning. You can see a decent single DD response being crossed over with the BA around 6kHz. That notch at 6kHz can be found with quite a few DD + BA hybrid. That notch by itself is okay, no problem. However, Michael tuned the BA tweeter at least 3dB too much. The valley at 6kHz contrast strongly against the sustained treble and upper treble disturbs the expected balance harmonics. The valley between 4kHz to 6kHz also creates an unnatural colouring, almost muffling on the midrange in some tracks. To add salt to the insult, the 10-12kHz, the region that is responsible for that edgy, metallic tone is very much highlighted. 



As a result, treble sounds plainly wrong with most music that brings orchestra or high brass in. Vocals are alright, most of the time, though I'm quite unhappy how this IEM present the voice of Andrea Boccelli: unnaturally harsh in higher notes. Needless to say, any track with excess or peaks in the treble, such as sibilant vocals, would sound punishing on this IEM. 



Let's talk about resolution of Project M. Yes, this IEM sounds detailed. Artificially so. Thanks to the excess treble and upper treble, I can easily hear micro details that are usually not present with other IEMs. However, I would argue that in terms of the true resolution, Project M is limited by the capability of its dynamic driver. Case and point, when I listen to a recording with dense instrumentation in the lower midrange (e.g., Now we are free by 2Cellos), I struggled to separate and track individual cellos, not to mention the background cello section and the doublebasses. The thinner and brighter tuning is not substitution for true resolution of the driver and implementation. 



​Bass and dynamic, on the other hand, is where Project M shines. It does not have the most amount of bass, but the bass feels snappy and dynamic with proper weight behind it. As a result, musics feel rhythmic and lively, despite not having an overwhelming amount of bass. I would say Project M has the snappy dynamic bass done right.
