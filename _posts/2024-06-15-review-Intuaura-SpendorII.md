Today, we look Splendor II, a single DD IEM from the Chi-Fi manufacturer Intuaura. It's a fun one. Let's talk about it. 

Forewords
===

- What I look for in an IEM is **immersion.** I want to feel the orchestra around my head, track individual instruments, and hear all of their textures and details. I'm not picky about tonality, as long as it is not make the orchestra, violin, cellos, and pianos sound wrong.
- I rate IEMs within with a consistent scale from **1 (Poor) to 3 (Good) to 5 (Outstanding)**. An overall ranking of 3/5 or above is considered positive. 
- Ranking list and measurement database are on [my IEM review blog](https://iegems.nk-tran.com/).
- The terminology for subjective impressions in this review is based on the Audio Wheel for reproduced sound defined in the technical report [ITU-R BS.2399-0](https://www.itu.int/pub/R-REP-BS.2399)
- **This review is based on a review sample from Linsoul (Thank you!).** I have no affiliation with or financial interest in Linsoul and Intuaura. 
- The unit retails for $259 at the time this review was published. Unaffiliated link: [Linsoul](https://www.linsoul.com/products/intuaura-splendorii)

General Information
===

Splendor II features a single dynamic driver (DD) topology.

The DD has 10mm diameter. According to Intuaura, diaphragm of the driver has a double-sided composite alloy coating giving it similar characteristics to that of a beryllium metal diaphragm. 

The DD is housed in 3D printed booth. 
This booth contains a large tube to direct the sound from the opening of the DD to the nozzles. 

The 3D printed booth also contains air release tubes and vents. I find the tubes and venting system of Splendor II intriguing. On the shell, there is a vent hole at the front of the DD to release the excess pressure, which is as expected. However, on the sound tube that direct sound to the nozzle, there is yet another pressure release tube that connect to a chamber behind the DD, hidden under the faceplate. This chamber releases pressure into large vents hidden underneath the word "VIEW" engraved on the top end of the shells. 

Needless to say, Splendor II is a very well vented IEM.

Non-sound Aspects
===

**Packaging and accessories** The packaging is somewhat unrefined: the outer cardboard sleeve is designed or printed at  low resolution, meaning text and artworks are blurry. The foam cutouts inside the box are not customised for the content. 

On the plus side, the provided content is generous and high quality: roomy and well protected leather case, two types of ear tips, a decent cable, and a USB DAC dongle with built in EQ. 

**Ear pieces design** Medium in shape and size. Nozzles are rather thick and short. However, the whole nozzle area protrudes further from the shells, making the earpieces quite easy to wear. 

**Fit, comfort and isolation** I have great fit with these IEMs. No discomfort in long listening sessions. The noise isolation is not strong due to the large amount of vent. On the plus side, there is no pressure build up or drive flex problem thanks to the ventilation. 

**Ear tips recommendation:** I have good experience with the stock wide bore ear tips.

The subjective impression is captured using the lexicon in the Sound Wheel below. I'll clarify the terminology as I use them. If you want to see more details of the lexicon and related reference, please have a look at the technical report [ITU-R BS.2399-0](https://www.itu.int/pub/R-REP-BS.2399).

**Timbre:**  *It is helpful to think of an IEM as a filter that highlights or subdues different parts of the incoming audio signal. This effect can be measured objectively by the squiggly lines below, called Frequency Response (FR) graphs, which measure how loud an IEM is at different frequencies from 20Hz (bass) to 20kHz (upper treble). Subjectivity is how your ears and brain interpret the effect of that filter on your music and decide whether it is "enjoyable." There are some "rules of thumb" when it comes to tonality, but most interesting IEMs usually bend the rules masterfully.*

*Figure shows the frequency response of Splendor II against the Harman in-ear target. Measurements were done with an IEC-711-compliant coupler and might only be compared with other measurements from this same coupler. Above 8kHz, the measurement likely does not match the response at the ear drum. Visit my [graph database](https://nk-tran.com/iegems-graphtool/) for more comparisons.*

The timbral balance of Splendor II can be defined as a full, homogeneous, V-shaped signature.
V-shaped means that the bass, lower midrange, and upper midrange is lifted comparing to the true midrange region. It means that the midrange instruments will sit further back in the mix whilst bass sits more forward. Midrange intruments and voices will sound thicker, denser, and more blended into the bass. Some high notes, such as on the E string of violin, can sound louder than the rest of the instrument.
Full means that the frequency response can extend towards both ends of the spectrum rather than limiting only to the middle. 
Homogeneous means that the whole frequency spectrum is presented in a coherent whole rather than segmented into different parts with gaps in between. 

The V-shaped tuning means that the midrange of Splendor II is not ideal if timbral correctness is what you are after. 
Example: album: "Bach: Sei Solo" by Leonidas Kavakos: the violin does not sound even, the G string and E string are unnaturally accentuated. 
Example: "Goldberg Variations" performed by Lang Lang: the piano sounds uneven. The whole presentation has a slight sense of boominess and boxiness that I don't really enjoy. 
On the other hand, Splendor II fares pretty well with pop musics and large orchestral works as the V-shaped tuning make these music feels large and exciting. 

When paired the supplied DAC/amp, the tonality of Splendor II changes dramatically, taking a "neutral" sonic profile. 
The frequency response feel flatter.
Bass is less emphasised.
The lower midrange is less emphasised. 
The mid-midrange is more forwared.
The upper midrange stands out more. 
This tonal balance is arguably more "correct", but I find it a tad boring comparing to the other sound signature. 

**Bass and perceived dynamic:** Dynamic is the strength of Splendor II. Note attacks are snappy and "tight", not sloppy. Bass transient is tight and feels precise. Every bass note has a strong and satisfying sense of physical punch. This IEM feels powerful at both low and high volume. 

The amount of bass and preceived dynamic of Splendor II depends on whether you use the supplied DAC/amp. Without the supplied DAC/amp, Splendor II is bassy and punchy IEM. With the supplied DAC/amp, the amount of bass is lower, whilst the characteristic of the bass response remains the same. 

**Resolution:** *To me, "resolution" can be broken down into three components: (1) Sharpness, incisiveness, or "definition" of note attacks (see the figure above). (2) The separation of instruments and vocals, especially when they overlap on the soundstage. (3) The texture and details in the decay side of the notes. The first two give music clarity and make it easy to track individual elements of a mix. The last provides music details and nuances.*

The sense of clarity of Splendor II is somewhat limited due to the extra amount of bass and lower midrange. 
The presence of the midrange is also not excellent, due to the recessed midrange frequencies. 
However, Splendor II can still maintain a relatively clean and crisp presentation thanks to its snappy note attacks. 
The sense of detail is also good. I can listen to detail-rich classical recordings and do not feel that I have missed out too much details. 
If you use the supplied DAC/amp, you will find that the overall presetation of Splendor clearer with better clarity. This effect is due to the change in the frequency response. 
In direct comparison against my benchmarks, I find that Splendor II is as resolving as the Blessing 2. Thus, I rate the resolution of Splendor II in the 3/5 bracket (Good)



**Stereo imaging and soundstage:** *Stereo imaging or "soundstage" is a psychoacoustic illusion that different recording elements appear at various locations inside and around your head. Your brain creates based on the cues in the recording, which are enhanced or diminushed by your IEMs, your DAC, and your amplifier. In rare cases, with some specific songs, some IEMs can trick you into thinking that the sound comes from the environment (a.k.a., "holographic")*

Regarding the soundstage extension: Splendor II creates an enveloping soundstage that has a strong perception of depth. Example: "Gladiator Suite" in the album Live by Hans Zimmer, I hear the bass strong and near at the at foregroud, thumping at my throat level, the main flute instrument sitting further back, and the string section floating further back and to the sides, triggering the illusion that they come from outside the head stage. 

Regarding the sound localisation: Splendor II has strong localisability, meaning it is easy to identify the position and distance of instruments. If I have a complaint here, it would be that the sound localisation of Splendor II still lacks a laser sharp precision. Splendor II belongs to the small group of IEMs that can create the illusion that some parts of the soundstage apper from outside the head, given the right recording. 

When pitched against the benchmarks in my collection, I found that Splendor II projects a significantly more 3D and open soundstage than my Blessing 2 (my benchmark for the 3/5 level). Splendor II matches the 3D soundstage illusion of my Andromeda 2020 (benchmark for the 4/5 level). However, in direct comparison against my benchmark for 5/5, the 64 Audio U12T, I found that the Splendor II lacks the precise imaging to achieve a truely outstanding soundstage and imaging. 

**Multimedia usage:**

The V-shaped tuning and the expansive soundstage makes Splendor II a splendid choice for video games and movies. 
In FPS games, I can hear around spherical soundstage around my head, making it easy to identify and track both direction and distance of the sound.
In action movies, the bass response and the open soundstage create a satisfying experience.

Driveability
===

Spendor II is a very easy to drive IEM. It sounds excellent already with the humble Apple dongle DAC/amp: the soundstage is properly extended, dynamic is good, bass feels good. 

When switching to a good dongle DAC/amp like the W4, I hear refinements across the range: instruments are more separated, the soundstage spreads out more, and the bass transients are a bit more defined and impactful. However, it was not a day and night difference.

Conclusions
===

Despite all of my nitpicking about the tonality of Splendor II, I'm surprised by how much I enjoy using this IEM. Yes, it wouldn't win any award regarding tonality without the supplied DAC/amp with built in EQ. But at the same time, the stock tuning is just pure FUN, thanks to the thick bass, strong dynamic, and large soundstage. Another advantage is how easy it is to drive, making it a practical gadget with wide utility, beyond audiophile use cases. 

Should you buy this IEM? It depends on your music library. If you listen to a lot classical recordings and thus pay significant attention to the timbral correctness, this IEM might not be a good choice unless you are willing to use the supplied DAC/amp all the time. But if you look for something fun, especially for multimedia consumption, Splendor II receives a recommendation from this reviewer. 


**What I like about this IEM:**

- Fun V-shaped signature
- Bass and dynamic
- Soundstage depth
- The openness sensation of the soundstage
- Two sound signatures in one product
- Generous and practical accessories

**What could be improved:**

- Timbral correctness 
- The supplied DAC/amp has a slight hissing noise

**Absolute Sonic Quality Rating:** 3.5/5 - Very Good
