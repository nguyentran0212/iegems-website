No matter how I look at it, at the time I write this review, the economy does not look bright. It means audiophiles need to tightened up their wallet and manufacturers need to find a way to squeeze through this tightening, generally by releasing more budget friendly entries. Today, we look at **Pilgrim**, the latest entry in this incredibly crowded market from the illustrious Eastern boutique *Elysian Acoustic Labs*. 

Forewords
===

- What I look for in an IEM is **immersion.** I want to feel the orchestra around my head, track individual instruments, and hear all of their textures and details. I'm not picky about tonality, as long as it is not make the orchestra, violin, cellos, and pianos sound wrong.
- I rate IEMs within with a consistent scale from **1 (Poor) to 3 (Good) to 5 (Outstanding)**. An overall ranking of 3/5 or above is considered positive. 
- Ranking list and measurement database are on [my IEM review blog](https://iegems.nk-tran.com/).
- The terminology for subjective impressions in this review is based on the Audio Wheel for reproduced sound defined in the technical report ITU-R BS.2399-0
- **I purchase the unit for this review at a discount from Hifigo.** I have no affiliation with or financial interest in Hifigo and Elysian Acoustic Labs. 
- The unit retails for $400 at the time this review was published. Unaffiliated link: [Hifigo webstore](https://hifigo.com/products/elysian-acoustic-labs-pilgrim)

General Information
===

Pilgrim is a hybrid IEM consisting of 1 dynamic driver (DD) and 3 balanced armature drivers (BA). The DD has a diameter of 9.2mm, featuring a magnesium-alluminium alloy diaphgram and "liquid silicone rubber" surround. This design promises long excursion (flexible surround) whilst maintaining minimal distortion and agility (metal diaphram), allowing its bass response to reach as low as 10Hz. 

The BA drivers include Sonion 2300 midrange driver and Sonion E50 tweeter driver. The incoming signal are splitted across three types of drivers using a 3-way crossover circuit. All drivers output into a 3D printed internal chamber, easing the production and increasing the consistency and qualtiy control. 

Non-sound Aspects
===

Elysian Acoustic Labs is well known for being theatric with their packaging, and it's good to see that trend continues with Pilgrim. The IEM comes in a cubical box, and the unboxing experience is quite elaborated. Like other Elysian IEMs, Pilgrim comes with a set of Spinfit ear tips. 

**Ear pieces design:** The earpieces are fully metal. They are not shaped to lock into the outer ears like others that are shaped like custom IEMs. The faceplate of Pilgrim is quite intricate with alternative rings of matte and polished metal. In traditional Elysian fashion, Pilgrim has substantial nozzles that are slightly too large for the supplied spin fit tips. 

**Fit, comfort and isolation:** After finding the right ear tips to pair with Pilgrim, I find this IEM to be comfortable with average isolation, not unlike other vented IEMs. I did not experience pressure build up nor driver flex in my tests. 

**Ear tips recommendation:** I don't think the spinfit tips are good fit for Pilgrim (or most Elysian IEMs). Like most IEMs with strong treble response, the choice of ear tips is crucial. I find that Pilgrim works best with ear tips that push the nozzles deeper into the ear canal to avoid unwanted treble peaks. My top choices are Tri Clarion and Velvet ear tips at the right size so that the ear pieces rest against the concha of my ears. In this configuration, I have no problem with tonal brightness of treble of Pilgrim.

**Timbre:** *Figure shows the frequency response of Pilgrim against the Harman in-ear target. Measurements were done with an IEC-711-compliant coupler and might only be compared with other measurements from this same coupler. Above 8kHz, the measurement might not be correct. Visit my [graph database](https://nk-tran.com/iegems-graphtool/) for more comparisons.*

*It is helpful to think of an IEM as a filter that highlights or subdues different parts of the incoming audio signal. This effect can be measured objectively by the squiggly lines above, called Frequency Response (FR) graphs, which measure how loud an IEM is at different frequencies from 20Hz (bass) to 20kHz (upper treble). Subjectivity is how your ears and brain interpret the effect of that filter on your music and decide whether it is "enjoyable." There are some "rules of thumb" when it comes to tonality, but most interesting IEMs usually bend the rules masterfully.*

The tonal balance of Pilgrim can be described as *slightly* neutral-bright with a full and fairly homogeneous frequency response. Let's unpack this statement. By "slightly" neutral-bright, I mean the Pilgrim mostly achieves a balance in the loudness of bass, midrange, and treble, but the treble is a bit more emphasised than the bass. Meanwhile, the midrange sounds perfectly uncoloured. The music reproduction of Pilgrim is "full" and because it has strong extension toward both ends of the frequency spectrum. The homogeneity or "coherence" of Pilgrim is acceptable, in the sense that it does not have any significant gap across the frequency response (e.g., between bass and midrange), but there is still a sense of segmentation between bass, mid, and treble. These impressions holds across vocal-centric "weeb music" (Kimi wa Boku ni Nineiru by See-Saw), progressive rock (Playing God by Polyphia), orchestral (Nimbus 2000 from "John Williams: The Berlin Concert"), and epic soundtrack (Victory by Two Setps from Hell). Depending on your choice of ear tips and how you fit the IEM, the treble might be more or less sizzle. I have zero problem with the brightness of Pilgrim, even with "deadly" recordings like Shivers by Ed Sheeran, after opting for Tri Clarion and a deeper fit. 

The treble of Pilgrim is slightly above neutral in quantity, with a high level of briliance. The treble of Pilgrim is highly extended, creating a sense of airiness and openess in the reproduced music. The treble also has strong clarity. 

The midrange of Pilgrim is quite loud in the mix, meaning voices and instruments are often pushed forward and present. I rarely find myself adjusting volume to hear the midrange more clearly when testing Pilgrim. 

The bass of Pilgrim keeps up with the midrange in terms of loudness. I didn't need to turn up the volume to hear more bass details or impact. The bass extends deep into the subbass, meaning rumble and physical impact can be felt, though Pilgrim does not exaggerate these qualities. I didn't detect any hint of boominess or boxiness with bass response during my tests. However, I do wish that Elysian tunes the Pilgrim with a bit more bass to highlight the available bass quality. 

**Dynamic:** The representation of dynamic is both a strength of Pilgrim and an area where I wish it does a better job. Confusing? Let's unpack.

A good track to highlight the dynamic reproduction of Pilgrim would be "The Way of the Samurai" from the Ghost of Tsushima soundtracks. Every transient (e.g., drum hits, articulation from the strings) is snappy, accurate, and clear. The bass feels precise. Every bass note has a physical sensation, as if there is pressure pushed against the ear drums. In other words, Pilgrim is a snappy IEM.

However, I wish that Elysian pushes the dynamic of Pilgrim just a touch further, perhaps by raising both the bass and the treble by a few dB. Even though Pilgrim already has a powerful presentation, it left me wanting even *more* of that snappy, tactile response. This is not an impossible request, as both of Pilgrim's siblings that I happen to have for comparison, the Gaea and Annihilator 2023, *slam* harder in A/B tests. 

**Resolution:** *To me, "resolution" can be broken down into three components: (1) Sharpness, incisiveness, or "definition" of note attacks (see the figure below). (2) The separation of instruments and vocals, especially when they overlap on the soundstage. (3) The texture and details in the decay side of the notes. The first two give music clarity and make it easy to track individual elements of a mix. The last provides music details and nuances.*

The resolution of Pilgrim is quite impressive. This IEM excels in clarity, presence, and cleanness. It means that even with busy tracks like the Ghost of Tsushima soundtracks or the controlled chaos in the "Remember That You Will Die" album by Polyphia, Pilgrim maintains an impressive ability to keep instruments spatially separated on the soundstage whilst maintaining the timbral accuracy of each and ensuring that important parts of the mix are upfront and highlighted. Yes, the clear stereo image of Pilgrim does falter to some degree when I listen closely, especially in comparison with "top of the line" IEMs like its sibling Annihilator 2023. But still, in a vacuum, Pilgrim is a crystal clear IEM. 

Pilgrim is also highly competent at detail retrieval. For instance, when I listen to "Bach: Sei Solo" album by Leonidas Kavakos, I can hear nuances and texture in the sound of violin and easily discern the reverberation of the hall where the recordings were made. It also held its own in direct comparison against benchmark IEMs for good detail retrieval in my collection and only truely falters when pitched against the likes of U12T and Annihilator 2023. 

**Spatial:** *Stereo imaging or "soundstage" is a psychoacoustic illusion that different recording elements appear at various locations inside and around your head. Your brain creates based on the cues in the recording, which are enhanced or diminushed by your IEMs, your DAC, and your amplifier. In rare cases, with some specific songs, some IEMs can trick you into thinking that the sound comes from the environment (a.k.a., "holographic"). The figure below shows how I hear and describe soundstage*

![](/assets/images/soundstage.png)

The spatial reproduction is where I have the most bones to pick with Pilgrim. Precise but lacking immersion is how I would describe the soundstage and imaging of Pilgrim.

First, let's talk about "spatial extent", or the shape and size of the soundstage. On the plus side, Pilgrim has great width, meaning the left-to-right stretch of the stage is quite competent and sounds all the way to the sides, such as the voice of Kirstin from Pentatonix in "Bohemian Rhapsody", can appear outside the ears, hovering my shoulders. On the other hand, the depth is not great. Simply put, most of the "action" on the soundstage of Pilgrim is condense on a flat plane, without much contrast between closer and further away sound. As a result, the soundstage of Pilgrim does not create a strong envelopment illusion (i.e., not "wrapping" around the head). 

Next, let's talk about "localisation": the ability to pin point location and size of audio sources within a soundstage. As I mentioned above, the sense of distance is not a strong suit of Pilgrim due to the way it shapes the soundstage. Similarly to majority of IEM, sound sources are primarily perceived as coming from inside the head, unless they are panned all the way to the sides. Fortunately, the precision of the location is quite good with Pilgrim, meaning it is quite easy for me to pin point the location and size of the sound sources on the soundstage. 

**Multimedia usage:**

The precise sound localisation of Pilgrim translates to excellent performance in FPS gaming. For example, in CS:GO, it is easy to pin point and track the angle and distance of footsteps and gunshots. I'm surprised that the lack of soundstage depth of Pilgrim does not translate to a disadvantage in pin pointing sounds coming from the front in these games. Action movies also sound good with Pilgrim.


Driveability
===

Main test track: Playing God - Polyphia

As usual, I started my tests with the humble Apple dongle. My first impression was a congested and condense soundstage. Moreover, both the bass extension and treble extension suffers. It seems that even though the apple dongle can provide the voltage, it cannot maintain good enough current supply to drive the Pilgrim well. Whilst the sound is not outright bad, I cannot recommend this pairing due to how much performance is lost.

Switching to a good dongle like the L&P W4, I immediately notice more spacious soundstage and better subbass response. The improvement from W4 to DX300 was not as noticeable, though the DX300 does change the tonality of Pilgrim slightly, making the midrange warmer and thicker. 

Just for fun, I pair Pilgrim with Topping G5 acting as pure amplifier for DX300. I hear an even snappier transient response and the stage has more sense of depth and layering. This result suggests that Pilgrim can "scale" with desktop-class setups. I would leave it to readers to explore this path.


Comparisons

Main test track: [One Winged Angel - The Danish National Symphony Orchestra](https://youtu.be/yAV1Lfkzrn8?si=XUebifO9lOP-3All)

**Vs AFUL Performer8**: The Performer8 (P8) is one of the overachiever in the "mid-fi" market in terms of resolution and imaging precision. In fact, it was one of the first IEM I tested that can squarely match my benchmark for "great" level of technical performance on these aspects. Therefore, my first AB test for Pilgrim must definitely be against the P8. My first observation is how these IEMs are tuned so similarly. Both have a "flat" midrange with reserved upper midrange, strong bass extension, and strong treble extension. At the same time, the tonality of these IEMs are also so different, the point that they always make the midrange of the others feel uncanny within the first few second of switching from one IEM to the other. This difference is most likely due to the way they tune the 1.25kHz region. I prefer the more conventional approach of Pilgrim here. 

Regarding resolution and imaging, I spent quite a lot of time switching back and forth, twisting my ears to try to hear the difference, but in the end I have to conclude that they are practically identical. Similar note defintion, similar instrument separation, similar micro details at the decay of the notes, similar precise imaging, similar shallow soundstage. If I nitpick, I would say Pilgrim has a bit more texture, detail, and extension in the bass region, and the stage of Pilgrim is a bit less "flat" than P8. 

**Vs Andromeda 2020**: The Andromeda 2020 has been and remains to be my benchmark for the "great" level of resolution and staging. How does Pilgrim fare? The first difference is the tonality: the Pilgrim's midrange is more neutral whilst Andromeda 2020 is slightly warmer. Moving past the tonality, the next key difference is the bass response. The bass of Pilgrim is simply better, no matter how I look at it. Where Andromeda 2020 beats Pilgrim soundly is the shape of the stage. In back to back comparison, Andromeda 2020 exaggerates how flat the stage of Pilgrim is. Resolution wise, the Pilgrim emphasise note attacks more, but overall, they separate instruments and resolve detail practically at the same level. 

**Vs Annihilator 2023**: Annhilator 2023 (Anni 2023) is a "tri-brid" flagship of Elysian (if we don't count the shadowy and exclusive "Dio" prototypes that is pretty much a folklore for average joes like myself). In fact, when we think of Elysian, I think many of us immediately think of Annihilator. Some of us enthusiastically predicted that Pilgrim would be the "baby Annihilator." Is there any truth in this prediction?

Not really. Firstly, these IEMs are tuned differently. Whilst Elysian is mostly neutral IEM, Anni 2023 is pretty much a V-shaped hype machine. Stronger midbass and more treble energy across the entire frequency range make Anni 2023 noticeably more punchy and exciting than Pilgrim. When the beat drop, Anni 2023 is head banging whilst Pilgrim is ... alright. Regarding the resolution, whilst Pilgrim is a resolving IEM as demonstrated in the previous comparisons, it is noticeably less detailed in AB tests against the Anni 2023. For instance, after listening to the choral section with Anni 2023, I'm surprised to find how mushy, less separated, and less detailed the choral sectio is rendered by Pilgrim. The same situation is applied to every other instruments as well as the subtle reverberation in the track. 

**Vs Effect Audio x Elysian Gaea**: Gaea is a divisive IEM. Similarly to Anni 2023, it is a V-shaped hype machine that can be too intense for some listeners and libraries. I quite like this IEM for larger orchestral pieces and "epic soundtrack", when I need an energy boost. So, how does the Pilgrim compare against the Gaea?

First thing first, Pilgrim is obviously less energetic and dynamic than Gaea. On the other hand, vocals on Pilgrim are always spot on whilst some voices can be quite shrill and strident with Gaea. When it comes to resolution, Gaea is half to one step ahead regardless of how I look at it. The stage of Gaea also sounds more 3D, which translate to a more immersive experience for the type of music that I pair the Gaea with. Your music library and your taste would determine the choice between these IEMs. 

Conclusions
===

Elysian Acoustic Labs came out swinging in the "mid-fi" market with the Pilgrim. No, it is not the fabled "baby Annihilator" that some of us have hoped for before the release. Yet, Pilgrim does carries the torch of its forebearer, the DIVA and Annihilator, with excellent treble extension, excellent bass extension, and a natural tonal balance that elevates vocal music. The theatric flairs in packaging and accessories of DIVA and Annhilator are also preserved as much as the budget allows. The tuning, the technical performance, build quality, and overall packaging make Pilgrim an alrounder and compelling IEM, and in my opinion, a worthy addition to the Elysian Acoustic Labs family. 

Should you get Pilgrim? As always, the answer is "it depends." If you prefer your music to be rich, warm, and "analogue," this IEM is not a good choice. If you want an exaggerated, big, bold, even mushy / bleedy bass response, then this IEM is also not a good choice. If you want an enveloping and engaging soundstage, this IEM might also not be the one. But if you want a snappy, clean, clear, neutral presentation with excellent vocal reproduction, if you want clarity and details, Pilgrim receives a recommendation from this reviewer. 

**What I like about this IEM:**

- Neutral tonality with highlighted midrange
- Clarity and detail
- Snappy transient response
- Bass quality and extension
- Precise stereo imaging
- Beautiful design and build quality

**What could be improved:**

- Flat, unengaging soundstage
- I wish this IEM is even more dynamic and explosive

**Absolute Sonic Quality Rating:** 5/5 - Outstanding

**Bias Score:** 4/5 - I like this IEM
