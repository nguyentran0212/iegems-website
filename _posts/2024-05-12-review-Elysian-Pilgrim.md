Opening phrase

Forewords

- What I look for in an IEM is **immersion.** I want to feel the orchestra around my head, track individual instruments, and hear all of their textures and details. I'm not picky about tonality, as long as it is not make the orchestra, violin, cellos, and pianos sound wrong.
- I rate IEMs within with a consistent scale from **1 (Poor) to 3 (Good) to 5 (Outstanding)**. An overall ranking of 3/5 or above is considered positive. 
- Ranking list and measurement database are on [my IEM review blog](https://iegems.nk-tran.com/).

**Resolution:** *To me, "resolution" can be broken down into three components: (1) Sharpness, incisiveness, or "definition" of note attacks (see the figure above). (2) The separation of instruments and vocals, especially when they overlap on the soundstage. (3) The texture and details in the decay side of the notes. The first two give music clarity and make it easy to track individual elements of a mix. The last provides music details and nuances.*

**Stereo imaging and soundstage:** *Stereo imaging or "soundstage" is a psychoacoustic illusion that different recording elements appear at various locations inside and around your head. Your brain creates based on the cues in the recording, which are enhanced or diminushed by your IEMs, your DAC, and your amplifier. In rare cases, with some specific songs, some IEMs can trick you into thinking that the sound comes from the environment (a.k.a., "holographic")*

**Multimedia usage:**



Frequency Response Analysis
===

*Frequency response of Crimson against Helios and the Harman in-ear target. Measurements were done with an IEC-711-compliant coupler and might only be compared with other measurements from this same coupler. Above 8kHz, the measurement might not be correct. Visit my [graph database](https://nk-tran.com/iegems-graphtool/) for more comparisons.*

*It is helpful to think of an IEM as a filter that highlights or subdues different parts of the incoming audio signal. This effect can be measured objectively by the squiggly lines above, called Frequency Response (FR) graphs, which measure how loud an IEM is at different frequencies from 20Hz (bass) to 20kHz (upper treble). Subjectivity is how your ears and brain interpret the effect of that filter on your music and decide whether it is "enjoyable." There are some "rules of thumb" when it comes to tonality, but most interesting IEMs usually bend the rules masterfully.*

**Vs AFUL Performer8**: The Performer8 (P8) is one of the overachiever in the "mid-fi" market in terms of resolution and imaging precision. In fact, it was one of the first IEM I tested that can squarely match my benchmark for "great" level of technical performance on these aspects. Therefore, my first AB test for Pilgrim must definitely be against the P8. My first observation is how these IEMs are tuned so similarly. Both have a "flat" midrange with reserved upper midrange, strong bass extension, and strong treble extension. At the same time, the tonality of these IEMs are also so different, the point that they always make the midrange of the others feel uncanny within the first few second of switching from one IEM to the other. This difference is most likely due to the way they tune the 1.25kHz region. I prefer the more conventional approach of Pilgrim here. 

Regarding resolution and imaging, I spent quite a lot of time switching back and forth, twisting my ears to try to hear the difference, but in the end I have to conclude that they are practically identical. Similar note defintion, similar instrument separation, similar micro details at the decay of the notes, similar precise imaging, similar shallow soundstage. If I nitpick, I would say Pilgrim has a bit more texture, detail, and extension in the bass region, and the stage of Pilgrim is a bit less "flat" than P8. 

**Vs Andromeda 2020**: The Andromeda 2020 has been and remains to be my benchmark for the "great" level of resolution and staging. How does Pilgrim fare? The first difference is the tonality: the Pilgrim's midrange is more neutral whilst Andromeda 2020 is slightly warmer. Moving past the tonality, the next key difference is the bass response. The bass of Pilgrim is simply better, no matter how I look at it. Where Andromeda 2020 beats Pilgrim soundly is the shape of the stage. In back to back comparison, Andromeda 2020 exaggerates how flat the stage of Pilgrim is. Resolution wise, the Pilgrim emphasise note attacks more, but overall, they separate instruments and resolve detail practically at the same level. 

**Vs Annihilator 2023**: Annhilator 2023 (Anni 2023) is a "tri-brid" flagship of Elysian (if we don't count the shadowy and exclusive "Dio" prototypes that is pretty much a folklore for average joes like myself). In fact, when we think of Elysian, I think many of us immediately think of Annihilator. Some of us enthusiastically predicted that Pilgrim would be the "baby Annihilator." Is there any truth in this prediction?

Not really. Firstly, these IEMs are tuned differently. Whilst Elysian is mostly neutral IEM, Anni 2023 is pretty much a V-shaped hype machine. Stronger midbass and more treble energy across the entire frequency range make Anni 2023 noticeably more punchy and exciting than Pilgrim. When the beat drop, Anni 2023 is head banging whilst Pilgrim is ... alright. Regarding the resolution, whilst Pilgrim is a resolving IEM as demonstrated in the previous comparisons, it is noticeably less detailed in AB tests against the Anni 2023. For instance, after listening to the choral section with Anni 2023, I'm surprised to find how mushy, less separated, and less detailed the choral sectio is rendered by Pilgrim. The same situation is applied to every other instruments as well as the subtle reverberation in the track. 

**Vs Effect Audio x Elysian Gaea**: Gaea is a divisive IEM. Similarly to Anni 2023, it is a V-shaped hype machine that can be too intense for some listeners and libraries. I quite like this IEM for larger orchestral pieces and "epic soundtrack", when I need an energy boost. So, how does the Pilgrim compare against the Gaea?

First thing first, Pilgrim is obviously less energetic and dynamic than Gaea. On the other hand, vocals on Pilgrim are always spot on whilst some voices can be quite shrill and strident with Gaea. When it comes to resolution, Gaea is half to one step ahead regardless of how I look at it. The stage of Gaea also sounds more 3D, which translate to a more immersive experience for the type of music that I pair the Gaea with. Your music library and your taste would determine the choice between these IEMs. 

Conclusions
===

Elysian Acoustic Labs came out swinging in the "mid-fi" market with the Pilgrim. No, it is not the fabled "baby Annihilator" that some of us have hoped for before the release. Yet, Pilgrim does carries the torch of its forebearer, the DIVA and Annihilator, with excellent treble extension, excellent bass extension, and a natural tonal balance that elevates vocal music. The theatric flairs in packaging and accessories of DIVA and Annhilator are also preserved as much as the budget allows. The tuning, the technical performance, build quality, and overall packaging make Pilgrim an alrounder and compelling IEM, and in my opinion, a worthy addition to the Elysian Acoustic Labs family. 

Should you get Pilgrim? As always, the answer is "it depends." If you prefer your music to be rich, warm, and "analogue," this IEM is not a good choice. If you want an exaggerated, big, bold, even mushy / bleedy bass response, then this IEM is also not a good choice. But if you want
