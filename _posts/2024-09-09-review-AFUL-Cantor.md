- What I look for in an IEM is **immersion.** I want to feel the orchestra around my head, track individual instruments, and hear all of their textures and details. I'm not picky about tonality, as long as it is not make the orchestra, violin, cellos, and pianos sound wrong.
- I rate IEMs within with a consistent scale from **1 (Poor) to 3 (Good) to 5 (Outstanding)**. An overall ranking of 3/5 or above is considered positive. 
- Ranking list and measurement database are on [my IEM review blog](https://iegems.nk-tran.com/).
- The terminology for subjective impressions in this review is based on the Audio Wheel for reproduced sound defined in the technical report [ITU-R BS.2399-0](https://www.itu.int/pub/R-REP-BS.2399)

**Timbre:**  *It is helpful to think of an IEM as a filter that highlights or subdues different parts of the incoming audio signal. This effect can be measured objectively by the squiggly lines below, called Frequency Response (FR) graphs, which measure how loud an IEM is at different frequencies from 20Hz (bass) to 20kHz (upper treble). Subjectivity is how your ears and brain interpret the effect of that filter on your music and decide whether it is "enjoyable." There are some "rules of thumb" when it comes to tonality, but most interesting IEMs usually bend the rules masterfully.*

*Figure shows the frequency response of XXXX against the Harman in-ear target. Measurements were done with an IEC-711-compliant coupler and might only be compared with other measurements from this same coupler. Above 8kHz, the measurement likely does not match the response at the ear drum. Visit my [graph database](https://nk-tran.com/iegems-graphtool/) for more comparisons.*

Overview of the timbre and tonal balance, with reference to the frequency response. Use the terminology of sound wheel.
- Timbral balance: dark-bright, full, homogeneous
- Midrange: nasal? canny? strength?
- Treble: brilliance, tinny? treble strength?
- Bass: bass strength? depth? boomy? boxy?

Next, let's discuss how XXXX present various types of voices and instruments in some test tracks. The first track is **[Shivers by Ed Sheeran](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2_Lrg6rRks)**, which is invaluable for checking the harshness and sibilance of an IEM, as well as its balance across the midrange frequencies. An IEM with ideal tonal balance would be able to control the harshness (e.g., starting from the chorus section) and imbue an emotive "warmth" to Ed's voice without making it muted or muffled. Here are key observations about how XXXX performs with this track:

The next track is **[Kiwi wa Boku ni Niteiru by See-Saw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6BkF23UPbM)**, which is an excellent song to test the ability of an IEM to handle female vocals in "weeb musics." An IEM with ideal tonal balance should be able to make the voice of Chiaki Ishikawa bright and clear, while maintaining enough energy in the lower midrange to avoid making the voice thin and harsh (a common problem with many IEMs with too much upper midrange boost). Here are key observations about how XXXX performs with this track:

The next track is **[Now We Are Free by 2CELLOS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74CYIdYoQ5w)**, which assesses an IEM's ability to render lower-midrange, particularly cellos. An IEM with ideal tonal balance should render cellos with a thick and authoritative tone and be able to reproduce the low pitch resonance and "rumble" of the cello body. At the same time, it must avoid cutting the upper midrange and treble to the point of making the cellos sound muffled, muddy, or lacking clear articulation. Here are key observations about how XXXX performs with this track:

The next track is **[Playing God by Polyphia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5NoQg8LdDk)**. I focus on the tonal quality and the level of energy conveyed by the guitars. This track also helps assess the balance of the bass against the midrange, which is reflected by the relative loudness between the bass guitar and the rest of the music. Here are key observations about how XXXX performs with this track:

The next track on our list is the aria of **[Bach's Goldberg Variations, recorded by Lang Lang](https://youtu.be/linQUK6jNmg?si=v_2nz6exiNXsZUjU)**. I find that piano is the best instrument to assess the overall tonal balance of an IEM. Simply put, if the piano does not sound even across the frequencies, the midrange of an IEM is imbalanced. Here are key observations about how XXXX performs with this track:

The next track on our list is **[Ciaccona from Bach's Violin Partita No.2 in D Minor, performed by Kavakos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtA5DbswJ90)**. This track aims to assess two aspects: the rendition of violin and the reproduction of upper treble energy, which is reflected by the quality and detail of the reverberation and micro details at the decay end of violin notes. Here are key observations about how XXXX performs with this track:

The final track on our timbre test is **[Synchro BOM-BA-YE by Tokyo Kosei Wind Orchestra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lwPiXnOGZ4)**. This track aims to test the tonal balance and timbre of the upper midrange and treble region. There are two cues I focus on in this track: the hand claps at the beginning, and the tonal quality of all brass instruments throughout the track. Here are key observations about how XXXX performs with this track:



**Bass and perceived dynamic:**

Overview of the bass and dynamic using the soundwheel terminology:
- Attack
- Bass precision
- Punch
- Powerful

<!-- Oh, cantor is much snappier. It’s quite similar to the bass of Crimson, but i think cantor’s is a bit more textured and detailed in the subbass rumble. It’s quite accurate though, so if the track is not midbassy, it wouldn’t be midbassy, unlike Anni 2023. -->

Let's examine the bass and perceived dynamics of XXXX with some test tracks. The first one is **[A Reckoning in Blood from The Ghost of Tsushima OST](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaBMXXo-vdU)**. I'll focus on the crescendo at 01:10, which an ideal dynamic IEM should effectively communicate. Additionally, the beats from 02:50 need to be strong, snappy, and precise, requiring excellent control across the entire frequency range. Here are key observations about how XXXX performs with this track:

The next track is **[Strength of a Thousand Men (Live) by Two Steps from Hell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POmTXTBtRZA)**. I'll pay attention to the quality bass accompanying each beat. An IEM with perfect bass handling should convey a sense of "grippiness" and texture in the bass region, making the bass line growl rather than low-pitched hum. Lastly, every beat must be snappy and incisive to capture the marching energy of this track. Here are key observations about how XXXX performs with this track:

**Resolution:** *To me, "resolution" can be broken down into three components: (1) Sharpness, incisiveness, or "definition" of note attacks (see the figure above). (2) The separation of instruments and vocals, especially when they overlap on the soundstage. (3) The texture and details in the decay side of the notes. The first two give music clarity and make it easy to track individual elements of a mix. The last provides music details and nuances.*

Describe the resolution using the terminology from soundwheel:
- Clean
- Presence
- Clarity
- Detailed
- Natural

Let's elaborate on the resolution of XXXX with some test tracks. For the first track, we again listen to **[Ciaccona from Bach's Violin Partita No. 2 in D Minor, performed by Kavakos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtA5DbswJ90)**. I focus on the micro details such as the bow catching the strings. I also focus on the quality and nuances of the reverberation and decays of the notes. Here are key observations about how XXXX performs with this track and how it compares against other reference IEMs:

The next track is the "controlled chaos" **[ABC feat. Sophia Black by Polyphia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mtd24QIBJ5Y)**. With this track, I focus on an IEM's ability to not crumble under the complexity of overlapping layers in the mix. An IEM with ideal resolution would make it easy for me to hear everything, down to the very faint overdub by Sophia Black on the side channels right from the opening of the track. Here are key observations about how XXXX performs with this track and how it compares against other reference IEMs:

**Stereo imaging and soundstage:** *Stereo imaging or "soundstage" is a psychoacoustic illusion that different recording elements appear at various locations inside and around your head. Your brain creates based on the cues in the recording, which are enhanced or diminushed by your IEMs, your DAC, and your amplifier. In rare cases, with some specific songs, some IEMs can trick you into thinking that the sound comes from the environment (a.k.a., "holographic")*

![](/assets/images/soundstage.png)

Overview of the soundstage and imaging capability using the soundwheel terminology.:
- Spatial extent: depth, width, envelopment
- Localiation: distance, internality, localisability
- Reverberation

Let's listen to some test tracks to assess the soundstage and imaging capability of XXXX. The first one is **[Original Sound Effect Track - Memory from Gundam Seed Destiny OST album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhJWAWqExQs)**. This track compiles all sound effects used in the show, arranged atmospherically and immersively. An IEM with ideal soundstage and imaging should effectively utilize this information to create a diverse soundstage, with sound elements appearing in all three dimensions, offering contrast between near and distant sounds. Many elements on the left and right channels will seem to originate outside the ears. Here are key observations about how XXXX performs with this track and how it compares against other reference IEMs:

The next track is **[Shadow of Baar Dau](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXcLuLQ_5oM)**. This one tests an IEM's ability to convincingly convey the sense of distance of background elements, such as the string section at 00:20 on the front left and the vocal chants on the front right at 00:40. An IEM with perfect soundstage and imaging should make this track feel spacious, creating an illusion that some background elements originate outside the head. In essence, it should provide a fully immersive listening experience. Here are key observations about how XXXX performs with this track and how it compares against other reference IEMs:

Comparisons

**AFUL Cantor vs AFUL Performer8**: When swapping from Cantor to Performer8 (P8), I immediate noticed four differences. Firstly, the P8 was louder than Cantor at the same volume level, though not significantly more so. To put in context, I need to drop the volume from 28 to 22 on my DX300. 

The second difference was how much *flatter* the soundstage of the P8 feels. To be fair, both IEMs push the entire midrange forward to the listener in the same way. Moreover, both IEMs can separate the background elements (e.g., choral and string sections) from the foreground elements (e.g., main instruments and vocalists) and throw the background elements further into the background, away from the listener, thus both can sound spacious with the right track. The key difference is in the way these IEMs shape the foreground layers of the soundstage. Simply put, the foreground layers have more "thickness" on Cantor, meaning I can pin point nearer and further elements within the foreground of the mix (e.g., the singer is slightly closer whilst the main guitar is further back). On the other hand, P8 tends to compress the foreground layers into a relatively flat plane. 

The third difference was how much more *defined* the outline and boundary of elements on the soundstage are with Cantor. For example, when I listen to [soundtracks from The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLhUGq1nhdU&list=OLAK5uy_mN3k8ZkQfF2doXCm4zfKcMaBgT3QIN41U), I found that Cantor can make every instrument on the stage crystal clear and well separated, as if they *pop* from a black background. Meanwhile, everything feels more "blobby", less define, more cloudy, and the background feels more "gray-ish" with P8. As a result, it's harder to track and focus on individual parts of the mix with P8. When I "zoom" into individual parts of the mix, I found that P8 reveals less details and nuances than Cantor.  

The final difference was bass and dynamic. The difference was rather day and night when I listen to [A Reckoning in Blood from The Ghost of Tsushima OST](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaBMXXo-vdU) with both IEMs. The dynamic swings, such as the first beat drop at 01:10 was much more powerful and satisfying with Cantor. Every following beats are also more incisive with Cantor, giving the track stronger sense of energy and rhythm. The texture, details, and rumble of the drums are also noticeably better on Cantor. The difference persisted even when I turn the volume of P8 to be noticeably louder than Cantor to give it an advantage.

<!-- Third day with this gem.

So I have been wearing this IEM almost nonstop since this morning for commute and background music at work. Happy to report that there has been zero pressure build up because, surprise surprise, this IEM does have a pressure release mechanism similar to 64 Audio APEX. At first, I thought it was by sheer luck that I have no pressure build up, until I read the design document of these IEMs.

Despite pressure release, noise isolation is quite a bit above average, to the point it was kinda uncanny when, say, I saw water from the faucet when I do the dishes, but the sound of the water was so faint that it's almost inaudible with music on. Needless to say, this is not a great option when you need situational awareness.

I also received confirmation that Cantor has a 5-way crossover "with minimal overlap". This puts the crossover design in the upper echelons, just behind the crazy 7-way crossover of STORM.

Regarding scaling, I found that this IEM is not tricky to drive (i.e., not Symphonium/Subtonic level), but it's quite sensitive to the source chain somehow. I'm indifferent about how it sounds with my R3II, but feel much more enthusiastic with DX300 and W4. I guess you can call this "scaling"? I don't know. At 22ohm and 106dB, it sits in the sweet spot of most portable DAC/amp.

Sonic-wise, this IEM is extremely resolving, without any forced clarity or treble harshness (deep fit, of course). I like to throw my familiar tracks on this IEM and sit back and try to pick out all elements of the mix, all the details. I picked out many details in the percussion and bass instruments that I didn't notice before with my other IEMs. -->

<!-- It has 2BA for subbass and 2BA for midbass, so midbass is tight and snappy whilst the subbass is rumbling and textured whenever there is subbass in the music. Not as indulging as big DD bass like Anni 2023 but quite satisfying. Yes, this BA bass is better than U12t to me. -->

<!-- Good question. Thanks

To me, this IEM feels like a professionally calibrated computer screen with very high resolution, and very high contrast. It does not boost the vibrancy (ala "V-shaped" tuning), it does not add some sorts of "film simulation" filter (ala "warm", "musical tuning"), and it does not overly sharpen the image to make it appear more detailed (ala "bright" or "analytical" tuning). But, because of the high contrast (ala "bass boost"), the image is still rather striking.

Of course, one might find this presentation boring and prefer something more colourful, or perhaps a bit imperfect, which is fine. This Cantor IEM wouldn't give you that in the stock tuning, but it's so even across FR so it would be easy to EQ with just a simple 10-band graphical EQ.

I hope this makes some senses

(edit: in short, yes, neutral midrange, extended treble, with tight bass boost) -->
