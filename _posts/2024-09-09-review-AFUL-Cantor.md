Opening phrase
=======
It is not an exaggeration to say that I have been waiting a few years to finally write this review article. The reasons were twofold. Firtsly, the product itself took a long time arrive: it has been more than one year and multiple releases between the moment AFUL teased their flagship 14-driver IEM Cantor and time when it is finally here on my desk. Secondly, ever since the time I started reviewing IEMs a few years back, I have been waiting for someone, somewhere, somehow, to make *that* IEM, the one that makes me say: "This is it!" So, I hope you would excuse me if this review is somewhat more verbose and introspective than usual. I'll highlight the main points to help you skim, but if you would indulge me, grab a cup of something and get comfy. We are in for a ride. 

Forewords
===

- What I look for in an IEM is **immersion.** I want to feel the orchestra around my head, track individual instruments, and hear all of their textures and details. I'm not picky about tonality, as long as it is not make the orchestra, violin, cellos, and pianos sound wrong.
- I rate IEMs within with a consistent scale from **1 (Poor) to 3 (Good) to 5 (Outstanding)**. An overall ranking of 3/5 or above is considered positive. 
- Ranking list and measurement database are on [my IEM review blog](https://iegems.nk-tran.com/).
- The terminology for subjective impressions in this review is based on the Audio Wheel for reproduced sound defined in the technical report [ITU-R BS.2399-0](https://www.itu.int/pub/R-REP-BS.2399)
- **This review is based on a review sample purchased at a discount from Hifigo (Thank you!).** I have no affiliation with or financial interest in AFUL and Hifigo.

In pursue of the ideal
===

A fellow reviewer once said that a "perfect" IEM, the one that has no fault to the ears of any listener, is impossible because people's requirements are contradictory. For instance, an IEM can not simultaneously be perfect for a "basshead", a "treblehead", and a reference because the very act of tuning the frequency response toward bass or treble would turn an IEM away from a reference "flat" response, and vice versa. 

Whilst I fully agree that a perfect IEM is self-contradictory, I stubbornly believe that an "ideal" IEM is possible and actually should be pursued. This vision of the "ideal" IEM has since become the paradigm of how I look at IEMs, listen to IEMs, assess IEMs, and write about them. You can say its my "fundamental bias." so, what is that "ideal" IEM am I talking about?

To me, in order to talk about an "ideal" IEM, we need to take a step back and look at the IEMs themselves. What are they? What is their "point"? To me, IEMs serve but one purpose: faithfully translating electrical signals into sound waves. In other words, they are "screens" or "monitors" for the ears to "see" the audio content, be it music or movies or video games, as faithfully, clearly, and detailed as possible. They don't have to be to be "soulful", just as you wouldn't ask your TV to be "soulful."

The implication of my conceptualisation of IEMs is that an *ideal IEM, at least to me, is pretty much define-able and thus not a contradictory but a realistic target to shoot for.* In other words, an ideal IEM is the one that faithfully reflects the source material (a.k.a., "flat" response), with an extreme level of resolution down to the minute spatial cues and details. An ideal IEM should be so crystal clear that you can track and follow any individual element in the mix without difficulty, yet you can also sit back and see how the whole mix come together, without losing sight of components. It should be so detailed that voices and instruments in the mix feel *real.* The spacial cue should be so accurate that you can pin point both the direction and distance of the sound sources in a virtual sound field crafted by an audio engineer or a game engine. And it should do all of this without sounding like ice picks in your ears. 

What I find interesting is that there appear to be a strong relation between the actual construction and engineering effort behind an IEM and how close it is to the vision of an ideal IEM. For example, a smooth and even frequency response helps an IEM avoid the dreaded masking effect, allowing details to shine. The ability of an IEM to maintain smooth and audible response deep into the upper treble correlates to micro details and reproduction of spatial cues. A better cross-over design with minimal overlap between drivers tend to keep the sound clean and detailed. Cutting back on the use of dampening foams and filters tends to keep note attacks snappy and clean, further improving clarity, instrument separation, and details. So on and so forth. Engineering and ingenuity, not magic, power the "ideal" IEMs. 

Can we ever reach an ideal IEM? It's hard to say, since we need know what the maximum level of information crammed into recordings that we can extract and, in my experience, there has always been the next level. So, the path towards an ideal IEMs proceeds in two branches: (1) if we have unlimited resources, how close can we get to the top, and (2) with this limited resources available, how far can we go. In other words, the first path is the battle for "State of the Art" (SOTA), and the second path is the battle for productionalisation, to make SOTA available to many listeners. Both are interesting and challenging, but I have been leaning towards the second path. In fact, my entire method for assessing IEMs has been constructed for this second path: how close are we to the ideal with this limited budget we have. 

And that brings us back to the topic of the article today, the AFUL Cantor.

The subjective impression is captured using the lexicon in the Sound Wheel below. I'll clarify the terminology as I use them. If you want to see more details of the lexicon and related reference, please have a look at the technical report [ITU-R BS.2399-0](https://www.itu.int/pub/R-REP-BS.2399).

**Timbre:**  *It is helpful to think of an IEM as a filter that highlights or subdues different parts of the incoming audio signal. This effect can be measured objectively by the squiggly lines below, called Frequency Response (FR) graphs, which measure how loud an IEM is at different frequencies from 20Hz (bass) to 20kHz (upper treble). Subjectivity is how your ears and brain interpret the effect of that filter on your music and decide whether it is "enjoyable." There are some "rules of thumb" when it comes to tonality, but most interesting IEMs usually bend the rules masterfully.*

*Figure shows the frequency response of XXXX against the Harman in-ear target. Measurements were done with an IEC-711-compliant coupler and might only be compared with other measurements from this same coupler. Above 8kHz, the measurement likely does not match the response at the ear drum. Visit my [graph database](https://nk-tran.com/iegems-graphtool/) for more comparisons.*

Overview of the timbre and tonal balance, with reference to the frequency response. Use the terminology of sound wheel.
- Timbral balance: dark-bright, full, homogeneous
- Midrange: nasal? canny? strength?
- Treble: brilliance, tinny? treble strength?
- Bass: bass strength? depth? boomy? boxy?

Next, let's discuss how XXXX present various types of voices and instruments in some test tracks. The first track is **[Shivers by Ed Sheeran](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2_Lrg6rRks)**, which is invaluable for checking the harshness and sibilance of an IEM, as well as its balance across the midrange frequencies. An IEM with ideal tonal balance would be able to control the harshness (e.g., starting from the chorus section) and imbue an emotive "warmth" to Ed's voice without making it muted or muffled. Here are key observations about how XXXX performs with this track:

The next track is **[Kiwi wa Boku ni Niteiru by See-Saw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6BkF23UPbM)**, which is an excellent song to test the ability of an IEM to handle female vocals in "weeb musics." An IEM with ideal tonal balance should be able to make the voice of Chiaki Ishikawa bright and clear, while maintaining enough energy in the lower midrange to avoid making the voice thin and harsh (a common problem with many IEMs with too much upper midrange boost). Here are key observations about how XXXX performs with this track:

The next track is **[Now We Are Free by 2CELLOS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74CYIdYoQ5w)**, which assesses an IEM's ability to render lower-midrange, particularly cellos. An IEM with ideal tonal balance should render cellos with a thick and authoritative tone and be able to reproduce the low pitch resonance and "rumble" of the cello body. At the same time, it must avoid cutting the upper midrange and treble to the point of making the cellos sound muffled, muddy, or lacking clear articulation. Here are key observations about how XXXX performs with this track:

The next track is **[Playing God by Polyphia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5NoQg8LdDk)**. I focus on the tonal quality and the level of energy conveyed by the guitars. This track also helps assess the balance of the bass against the midrange, which is reflected by the relative loudness between the bass guitar and the rest of the music. Here are key observations about how XXXX performs with this track:

The next track on our list is the aria of **[Bach's Goldberg Variations, recorded by Lang Lang](https://youtu.be/linQUK6jNmg?si=v_2nz6exiNXsZUjU)**. I find that piano is the best instrument to assess the overall tonal balance of an IEM. Simply put, if the piano does not sound even across the frequencies, the midrange of an IEM is imbalanced. Here are key observations about how XXXX performs with this track:

The next track on our list is **[Ciaccona from Bach's Violin Partita No.2 in D Minor, performed by Kavakos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtA5DbswJ90)**. This track aims to assess two aspects: the rendition of violin and the reproduction of upper treble energy, which is reflected by the quality and detail of the reverberation and micro details at the decay end of violin notes. Here are key observations about how XXXX performs with this track:

The final track on our timbre test is **[Synchro BOM-BA-YE by Tokyo Kosei Wind Orchestra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lwPiXnOGZ4)**. This track aims to test the tonal balance and timbre of the upper midrange and treble region. There are two cues I focus on in this track: the hand claps at the beginning, and the tonal quality of all brass instruments throughout the track. Here are key observations about how XXXX performs with this track:



**Bass and perceived dynamic:**

Overview of the bass and dynamic using the soundwheel terminology:
- Attack
- Bass precision
- Punch
- Powerful

<!-- Oh, cantor is much snappier. It’s quite similar to the bass of Crimson, but i think cantor’s is a bit more textured and detailed in the subbass rumble. It’s quite accurate though, so if the track is not midbassy, it wouldn’t be midbassy, unlike Anni 2023. -->

Let's examine the bass and perceived dynamics of XXXX with some test tracks. The first one is **[A Reckoning in Blood from The Ghost of Tsushima OST](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaBMXXo-vdU)**. I'll focus on the crescendo at 01:10, which an ideal dynamic IEM should effectively communicate. Additionally, the beats from 02:50 need to be strong, snappy, and precise, requiring excellent control across the entire frequency range. Here are key observations about how XXXX performs with this track:

The next track is **[Strength of a Thousand Men (Live) by Two Steps from Hell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POmTXTBtRZA)**. I'll pay attention to the quality bass accompanying each beat. An IEM with perfect bass handling should convey a sense of "grippiness" and texture in the bass region, making the bass line growl rather than low-pitched hum. Lastly, every beat must be snappy and incisive to capture the marching energy of this track. Here are key observations about how XXXX performs with this track:

**Resolution:** *To me, "resolution" can be broken down into three components: (1) Sharpness, incisiveness, or "definition" of note attacks (see the figure above). (2) The separation of instruments and vocals, especially when they overlap on the soundstage. (3) The texture and details in the decay side of the notes. The first two give music clarity and make it easy to track individual elements of a mix. The last provides music details and nuances.*

![](/assets/images/resolution.jpg)

Describe the resolution using the terminology from soundwheel:
- Clean
- Presence
- Clarity
- Detailed
- Natural

Let's elaborate on the resolution of XXXX with some test tracks. For the first track, we again listen to **[Ciaccona from Bach's Violin Partita No. 2 in D Minor, performed by Kavakos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtA5DbswJ90)**. I focus on the micro details such as the bow catching the strings. I also focus on the quality and nuances of the reverberation and decays of the notes. Here are key observations about how XXXX performs with this track and how it compares against other reference IEMs:

The next track is the "controlled chaos" **[ABC feat. Sophia Black by Polyphia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mtd24QIBJ5Y)**. With this track, I focus on an IEM's ability to not crumble under the complexity of overlapping layers in the mix. An IEM with ideal resolution would make it easy for me to hear everything, down to the very faint overdub by Sophia Black on the side channels right from the opening of the track. Here are key observations about how XXXX performs with this track and how it compares against other reference IEMs:

**Stereo imaging and soundstage:** *Stereo imaging or "soundstage" is a psychoacoustic illusion that different recording elements appear at various locations inside and around your head. Your brain creates based on the cues in the recording, which are enhanced or diminushed by your IEMs, your DAC, and your amplifier. In rare cases, with some specific songs, some IEMs can trick you into thinking that the sound comes from the environment (a.k.a., "holographic")*

![](/assets/images/soundstage.png)

Overview of the soundstage and imaging capability using the soundwheel terminology.:
- Spatial extent: depth, width, envelopment
- Localiation: distance, internality, localisability
- Reverberation

Let's listen to some test tracks to assess the soundstage and imaging capability of XXXX. The first one is **[Original Sound Effect Track - Memory from Gundam Seed Destiny OST album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhJWAWqExQs)**. This track compiles all sound effects used in the show, arranged atmospherically and immersively. An IEM with ideal soundstage and imaging should effectively utilize this information to create a diverse soundstage, with sound elements appearing in all three dimensions, offering contrast between near and distant sounds. Many elements on the left and right channels will seem to originate outside the ears. Here are key observations about how XXXX performs with this track and how it compares against other reference IEMs:

The next track is **[Shadow of Baar Dau](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXcLuLQ_5oM)**. This one tests an IEM's ability to convincingly convey the sense of distance of background elements, such as the string section at 00:20 on the front left and the vocal chants on the front right at 00:40. An IEM with perfect soundstage and imaging should make this track feel spacious, creating an illusion that some background elements originate outside the head. In essence, it should provide a fully immersive listening experience. Here are key observations about how XXXX performs with this track and how it compares against other reference IEMs:

Comparisons
===

**AFUL Cantor vs AFUL Performer5**: There were quite a few surprises when I compared Cantor and Performer5 (P5). My first surprise was the lack of volume difference. I can swap between these IEMs without changing the volume setting on my DAP at all. 

The second surprise to me was how much more *defined and rhythmic* the Cantor feels compared to P5. For instance, whilst P5 can convey the dynamic swings such as the first beat drop at 01:10 in [A Reckoning in Blood from The Ghost of Tsushima OST](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaBMXXo-vdU), the swings are not stronger than those of Cantor. Moreover, the attack of the drum beats are more loose and less incisive with P5. As a result, Cantor sounds more snappy and energetic than P5. To add a knock out blow, the bass texture and details of Cantor is also noticeably ahead of P5. I would say the performance showcased by these two IEMs flew in the face of the dogma of our hobby that DD woofers are automatically better than BA woofers. 

The rest of the performance differences between Cantor and P5 were not surprising. For instance, Cantor is more resolving across the frequency spectrum. Imaging is more precise on Cantor. The best way I can explain the difference in the presentation of these IEMs is that P5 feels *cloudy* when I listen to it immediately after listening to Cantor: the background is not as dark, elements do not pop from the background as clearly. When instruments overlap, it is harder to separate them. That said, this cloudy sensation ceases to be *that* problematic after I listen to P5 exclusively for a few songs.  

**AFUL Cantor vs AFUL Performer8**: When swapping from Cantor to Performer8 (P8), I immediate noticed four differences. Firstly, the P8 was louder than Cantor at the same volume level, though not significantly more so. To put in context, I need to drop the volume from 28 to 22 on my DX300. 

The second difference was how much *flatter* the soundstage of the P8 feels. To be fair, both IEMs push the entire midrange forward to the listener in the same way. Moreover, both IEMs can separate the background elements (e.g., choral and string sections) from the foreground elements (e.g., main instruments and vocalists) and throw the background elements further into the background, away from the listener, thus both can sound spacious with the right track. The key difference is in the way these IEMs shape the foreground layers of the soundstage. Simply put, the foreground layers have more "thickness" on Cantor, meaning I can pin point nearer and further elements within the foreground of the mix (e.g., the singer is slightly closer whilst the main guitar is further back). On the other hand, P8 tends to compress the foreground layers into a relatively flat plane. 

The third difference was how much more *defined* the outline and boundary of elements on the soundstage are with Cantor. For example, when I listen to [soundtracks from The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLhUGq1nhdU&list=OLAK5uy_mN3k8ZkQfF2doXCm4zfKcMaBgT3QIN41U), I found that Cantor can make every instrument on the stage crystal clear and well separated, as if they *pop* from a black background. Meanwhile, everything feels more "blobby", less define, more cloudy, and the background feels more "gray-ish" with P8. As a result, it's harder to track and focus on individual parts of the mix with P8. When I "zoom" into individual parts of the mix, I found that P8 reveals less details and nuances than Cantor.  

The final difference was bass and dynamic. The difference was rather day and night when I listen to [A Reckoning in Blood from The Ghost of Tsushima OST](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaBMXXo-vdU) with both IEMs. The dynamic swings, such as the first beat drop at 01:10 was much more powerful and satisfying with Cantor. Every following beats are also more incisive with Cantor, giving the track stronger sense of energy and rhythm. The texture, details, and rumble of the drums are also noticeably better on Cantor. The difference persisted even when I turn the volume of P8 to be noticeably louder than Cantor to give it an advantage.

**AFUL Cantor vs AFUL Magic One**: Most of the differences between Cantor and other AFUL IEMs that I applied above apply to Magic One as well. For instance, Magic One sounds noticeably more cloudy and less detailed than Cantor. When the beats drop, Magic One does not sound as visceral as Cantor. However, I can hear the DNA of Magic One's bass tuning in the response of Cantor with the emphasis on tight and crisp note attack to convey a strong sense of rhythm (a.k.a., the infamous term "PRaT"). Surprsingly, I also found Magic One to convey less information in the treble air region than Cantor, making Magic One a more mid-range centric performer compared to Cantor. Regarding sensitivity, Magic One is noticeably harder to drive than Cantor. 

**AFUL Cantor vs AFUL Explorer**: This is the comparison that I look forward to the most, as Explorer is one of the most accomplished bass performer in AFUL line up before Cantor, in my opinion. So, how did Explorer fare?

Let's put the obvious out of the way. Yes, Explorer sounds more cloudy with less details and poorer instrument separation than Cantor. Surprisingly, I have no problem with the sense of space of Explorer when listening to spacious recordings such as the Ghost of Tsushima OST or Samuel Kim's epic covers. 

What surprised me the most was the bass response. Given that Explorer is a bass-centric IEM, it was expected that Explorer has louder bass than Cantor. What's interesting is how Explorer controls that bass response, ensuring that dynamic swings are well presented and bass attacks are snappy. More importantly, Explorer also manages to convey details and textures in bass instruments, not unlike Cantor. Whilst Cantor's bass is ultimately more precise and refined, I can totally understand if you find a small loss in bass quality in exchange for more indulgent bass quantity presented by Explorer a better choice. 

**AFUL Cantor vs Juzear 61T Butterfly**: You might be asking "why this comparison?" Well, one of the answer is "why not", but the more accurate one would be curiosity. Given that 61T is an IEM that I consider a "unicorn", I am quite curious how it fares against the Cantor, and I guess you do too. 

The first difference between these IEMs was the tuning. If you consider 61T to be "neutral", then you would find Cantor "cold" or "analytical". Alternatively, you find Cantor "neutral" or "reference", you would find 61T a bit too warm and muffled. Personally, I think both IEMs fall within the realm of "neutral" and both present the music in a quite natural manner. Resolution-wise, I find 61T to be quite cloudy after listening to Cantor. This difference is a combination of lower instrument separation and the masking of lower midrange. Regarding the bass, 61T has a larger bass amount, but the bass is not as snappy and detailed as Cantor. You can think of Cantor's bass presentation as precise jabs whilst 61T's bass is like being wacked on the head with a pillow. Your preference would determine which bass presentation is better. Regarding soundstage and imaging, I found that 61T and Cantor are quite close in terms of the shape and size of the stage, but Cantor is noticeably more precise with better layering effect (contrast between nearer and farther sounds in a mix).

**AFUL Cantor (Stock tips) vs Sony IER-Z1R (Sony silicone tips)**: Z1R is a legendary IEM when it comes to bass quality and soundstage (and also the difficulty of getting a good fit). How does Cantor fare? Using my favourite test tracks, the Ghost of Tsushima OST album, I put Cantor and Z1R on the scale. The first difference I observed was loudness: Z1R required 33/100 whilst Cantor needed 30/100 to reach the same listening volume. I'm slightly surprised by how closed the volume levels were, given the reputation of Z1R as a difficult to drive IEM.

The second difference was the resolution, in terms of both instrument separation and micro details. Whilst Z1R was certainly capable, Cantor consistently out-resolved it. Simply put, whilst both IEMs can separate and reveal all main elements in a mix effectively, Cantor goes one step further in terms of the little details of those instruments and of the fainter background elements. In other words, there are more *information* to listen to with Cantor whilst I run into a "veil" earlier with Z1R. This different is especially evidenced in slower but more detailed section such as the flute and string section between 0:40 to the crescendo at 1:00 in [A Reckoning in Blood from The Ghost of Tsushima OST](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaBMXXo-vdU). 

The next two differences were rather surprisingly to me. The first one was in the bass response. For instance, let's consider the penultimate track in the album, The Fate of Tsushima. This track has rather interesting bassline with a sequence of drum beats panning back and forth on the soundstage, accompanied by low pitch "growl" from what I assume some forms of acoustic bass. When it comes to the amount, or loudness, of the bass, Z1R wins hands down. It is simply more thumpy and satisfying, though I would argue that Z1R does not boost the bass *that* much so if the track is not bassy enough, this IEM would not change that. When it comes to bass quality the scale tips back towards Cantor, again, by a small margin. Both IEMs present the bass line with a great sense of rhythm and dynamic thanks to snappy note attacks. Both IEMs presents the low pitch information and texture very well, most notably in the low-pitched rumbles. So in some senses, Z1R is impressive by how tightly it controls its massive DD subwoofers, whilst Cantor is impressive how it manages to convey bass energy with plain old BA woofers. 

The final difference, or rather lack of difference, between Z1R and Cantor was the soundstage. Both IEMs craft similarly spacious soundstage that expands in all three dimensions. Cantor pushes the main content at the center of the soundstage forward more, whilst Z1R pulls the midrange back a touch, so in terms of the structure of the soundstage, I prefer Z1R's. However, Cantor takes back the lead when it comes to the incisiveness and precision of the placement of instruments on the soundstage.

Summary

**What I like about this IEM:**

- 

**What could be improved:**

- 

**Absolute Sonic Quality Rating:** 5/5 - Outstanding

**Bias Score:** 5/5 - I love this IEM!


<!-- Third day with this gem.

So I have been wearing this IEM almost nonstop since this morning for commute and background music at work. Happy to report that there has been zero pressure build up because, surprise surprise, this IEM does have a pressure release mechanism similar to 64 Audio APEX. At first, I thought it was by sheer luck that I have no pressure build up, until I read the design document of these IEMs.

Despite pressure release, noise isolation is quite a bit above average, to the point it was kinda uncanny when, say, I saw water from the faucet when I do the dishes, but the sound of the water was so faint that it's almost inaudible with music on. Needless to say, this is not a great option when you need situational awareness.

I also received confirmation that Cantor has a 5-way crossover "with minimal overlap". This puts the crossover design in the upper echelons, just behind the crazy 7-way crossover of STORM.

Regarding scaling, I found that this IEM is not tricky to drive (i.e., not Symphonium/Subtonic level), but it's quite sensitive to the source chain somehow. I'm indifferent about how it sounds with my R3II, but feel much more enthusiastic with DX300 and W4. I guess you can call this "scaling"? I don't know. At 22ohm and 106dB, it sits in the sweet spot of most portable DAC/amp.

Sonic-wise, this IEM is extremely resolving, without any forced clarity or treble harshness (deep fit, of course). I like to throw my familiar tracks on this IEM and sit back and try to pick out all elements of the mix, all the details. I picked out many details in the percussion and bass instruments that I didn't notice before with my other IEMs. -->

<!-- It has 2BA for subbass and 2BA for midbass, so midbass is tight and snappy whilst the subbass is rumbling and textured whenever there is subbass in the music. Not as indulging as big DD bass like Anni 2023 but quite satisfying. Yes, this BA bass is better than U12t to me. -->

<!-- Good question. Thanks

To me, this IEM feels like a professionally calibrated computer screen with very high resolution, and very high contrast. It does not boost the vibrancy (ala "V-shaped" tuning), it does not add some sorts of "film simulation" filter (ala "warm", "musical tuning"), and it does not overly sharpen the image to make it appear more detailed (ala "bright" or "analytical" tuning). But, because of the high contrast (ala "bass boost"), the image is still rather striking.

Of course, one might find this presentation boring and prefer something more colourful, or perhaps a bit imperfect, which is fine. This Cantor IEM wouldn't give you that in the stock tuning, but it's so even across FR so it would be easy to EQ with just a simple 10-band graphical EQ.

I hope this makes some senses
