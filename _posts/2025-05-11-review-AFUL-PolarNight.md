In the age of wireless technology and minituarised computers, it seems nothing can be more archaic than wired IEMs big bulky MP3 players that audiophiles love so much. But what if I tell you that within this niche of a hobby, there is yet another niche? 

Enter the flathead earbuds.

Do you remember the godawful earphones back in the days of cassette tapes, CDs, and early iPods? The ones that have big flat heads that just hanging outside the ear canals rather than going all the way in like *In-ear* Monitor (IEMs)? Yes, those are flathead earbuds. When IEMs dominate the personal audio market, it is easy to believe that flathead earbuds have been killed off for good. Surprisingly, they have been hanging around, being lowkey in the background, cherished by a small and passionate commmunity. 

And you know what? They have improved. Modern flathead earbuds are not your grandma's earbuds (or maybe yours from 20 years ago). In fact, when I receive some of your questions about recommendations for a new pair of IEMs, I think you are better served with a pair of modern earbuds instead. Scratch that, I think every personal audio aficionado should have a pair of modern earbuds in their bag. Or even better, everyone should try to build one at least once. 

But we are getting ahead of ourselves, so let's stick to factory-made earbuds. Today, we look at AFUL's newest and most unexpected release so far, the flathead earbuds PolarNight. 


Forewords
===

- What I look for in an IEM is **immersion.** I want to feel the orchestra around my head, track individual instruments, and hear all of their textures and details. I'm not picky about tonality, as long as it does not make the orchestra, violin, cellos, and pianos sound wrong.
- I rate IEMs within with a consistent scale from **1 (Poor) to 3 (Good) to 5 (Outstanding)**. An overall ranking of 3/5 or above is considered positive. 
- Ranking list and measurement database are onÂ [my IEM review blog](https://iegems.nk-tran.com/).
- The terminology for subjective impressions in this review is based on the Audio Wheel for reproduced sound defined in the technical report [ITU-R BS.2399-0](https://www.itu.int/pub/R-REP-BS.2399)
- **This review is based on a review sample provided by Hifigo (Thank you!).** I have no affiliation with or financial interest in Hifigo and AFUL.
- The unit retails for US$180 at the time this review was published. Unaffiliated link: [Hifigo Web Store](https://hifigo.com/products/aful-polarnight)

By now, I think us geeks in the personal audio community have developed quite an expectation when we look at a new release from AFUL because, let's face it, this Chinese audio boutique has not released a single dud since their first international release, the Performer 5 hybrid IEM. So, what does AFUL brings to the flathead earbuds table? 

First, let's talk facts from spec sheet. PolarNight is powered by an in-house developed 15.4mm dynamic driver with composite diaphragm, copper-clad aluminium voice coil and N52 magnet. In usual AFUL's fashion, the driver is tuned by multiple 3D printed acoustic structures. The earpieces are constructed from a combination of metal and resin components and support replaceable cables via MMCX connector. 

So far, PolarNight seems pretty standard, as far as modern earbuds go. So, where is the AFUL's usual "geekery"? That's the first question I asked when I heard about PolarNight. Interestingly, AFUL took a step back and looked at the entire landscape of flathead earbuds and identified the perenial weaknesses of the form factors, and used these as the starting point of the design process. In particular, they pointed out three limitations:

1. **Lack of sub-bass and weak bass response in general.** This lack of bass leads to an unrefined low-end response.
2. **Lack of vocal expressiveness.** In particular, the 15.4mm drivers and 14.2mm drivers used by flatheads earbuds tend to concentrate most of the energy around the 500Hz-2kHz region, neglecting the lower-midrange (down to 250Hz) and upper midrange (up to 4kHz), As a result, voices tend to sound boxy, lacking the right kind of warmth and the right kind of vibrancy.
3. **Limited soundstage height and resolution.** This limitation is caused by a combination of the overly concentrated response in the midrange region, poor treble extension, and limitations of the large full-ranged drivers in general.
