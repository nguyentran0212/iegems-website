In the age of wireless technology and minituarised computers, it seems nothing can be more archaic than wired IEMs and big bulky MP3 players that audiophiles love so much. But what if I tell you that thre is yet another niche within this niche of a hobby? 

Enter the flathead earbuds.

Do you remember the godawful earphones back in the days of cassette tapes, CDs, and early iPods? The ones that have big flat heads that just hanging outside the ear canals rather than going all the way in like *In-ear* Monitor (IEMs)? Yes, those are flathead earbuds. When IEMs dominate the personal audio market, it is easy to believe that they have killed off the earbuds for good. Surprisingly, they have been hanging around, being lowkey in the background, cherished by a small and passionate commmunity, away from the warp-speed of the "ChiFi" IEM market. Do-it-yourself community (DIYers) and manufacturers like Venture Electronics, FiiO, Dunu, NiceHck kept the form factor alive and pushed the boundary. 

And you know what? Earbuds have improved. A lot. In fact, when I receive some of your questions about recommendations for a new pair of IEMs, I think you are better served with a pair of modern earbuds instead. You want a wide, open soundstage? Earbuds. You want to avoid the annoying pressure build up in ear canals? Earbuds. You want that new and fancy "bone conduction" effect where the soundwave hits your ear conchas in addition to the ear drums? Earbuds. So on and so forth.

Today, let's have a look at PolarNight and see whether the stellar IEM maker AFUL has what it takes to push the earbuds technology forward.


Forewords
===

- What I look for in an IEM is **immersion.** I want to feel the orchestra around my head, track individual instruments, and hear all of their textures and details. I'm not picky about tonality, as long as it does not make the orchestra, violin, cellos, and pianos sound wrong.
- I rate IEMs within with a consistent scale from **1 (Poor) to 3 (Good) to 5 (Outstanding)**. An overall ranking of 3/5 or above is considered positive. 
- Ranking list and measurement database are onÂ [my IEM review blog](https://iegems.nk-tran.com/).
- The terminology for subjective impressions in this review is based on the Audio Wheel for reproduced sound defined in the technical report [ITU-R BS.2399-0](https://www.itu.int/pub/R-REP-BS.2399)
- **This review is based on a review sample provided by Hifigo (Thank you!).** I have no affiliation with or financial interest in Hifigo and AFUL.
- The unit retails for US$180 at the time this review was published. Unaffiliated link: [Hifigo Web Store](https://hifigo.com/products/aful-polarnight)

By now, I think us geeks in the personal audio community have developed quite an expectation when we look at a new release from AFUL because, let's face it, this Chinese audio boutique has not released a single dud since their first international release, the Performer 5 hybrid IEM. So, what does AFUL brings to the flathead earbuds table? 

First, let's talk spec sheet. PolarNight is powered by an in-house 15.4mm driver with 32ohm impedance and sensitivity of 108dB/mW @ 1kHz. This driver size is larger than the 14.8mm and 14.2mm drivers used by other manufacturers, meaning PolarNight would fill the concha area of your ears more fully, which could be better or worse depending on the structure of your ears. The earpieces are constructed from a combination of metal and resin components and support replaceable cables via MMCX connector. 

If you have been following AFUL, I guess your question so far would be: "Everything seems pretty standard. Where is AFUL's usual geekery?" That was also my first question when hearing about PolarNight. AFUL's answer starts from taking a step back and looking at the entire landscape of flathead earbuds to understand their perenial weaknesses, and used these as the starting point of the design process. In particular, AFUL went after three key limitations:

1. **Lack of sub-bass and weak bass response in general.** This lack of bass leads to an unrefined low-end response.
2. **Lack of vocal expressiveness.** In particular, the 15.4mm drivers and 14.2mm drivers used by flatheads earbuds tend to concentrate most of the energy around the 500Hz-2kHz region, neglecting the lower-midrange (down to 250Hz) and upper midrange (up to 4kHz), As a result, voices tend to sound boxy, lacking the right kind of warmth and the right kind of vibrancy.
3. **Limited soundstage height and resolution.** This limitation is caused by a combination of the overly concentrated response in the midrange region, poor treble extension, and limitations of the large full-ranged drivers in general.

The general directions that AFUL took to address these problems are pretty much the same path that DIYers and other manufacturers have been pursuing: improving the driver, and fine-tuning the acoustic structures to squeeze the most out of that driver whilst masking its problems. For the driver, AFUL uses an in-house 15.4mm driver containing a PET+PU diaphragm driven by N52 magnets and copper-clad aluminium voice coil. The drive is house in a metal cavity, which is attached to a resin structure that contains 3D printed channels for dampening the driver and amplifying bass response. If you feel a bit of deja vu, you are not alone. We are seeing the same design principle, enabled by the same high-precision 3D printing capability that we have have been in almost every AFUL's release so far. 

If we are more specific, the system that AFUL implemented this time in PolarNight is called "Dual-Resonance, Dual-Damping Amplitude Control System." As the name implies, PonarNight has two sets of vents. The first one, called Resonance Control Damping A is located in the vent holes that you can find on the metal cavity holding the driver. The other vent, called Resonance Control Damping B is at the top of the resin part of the shells, which is connected to a long resonant chamber that runs within the shells and connects to the empty "room" at the back of the driver. This B vent is closed with a foam, which you can pull out and replace. 


Experience

But enough with the specsheet and theory. How does it feel to use PolarNight? 

To answer this question, I have used PolarNight as my daily driver perhaps for over a month, perhaps much longer than anticipated by both Hifigo/AFUL and myself. I spent around six to seven hours a day, 5 days a week with these earbuds in my ears to provide background music at work. The comfort, as you might have guessed based on the long hour, is stellar. I have not been able to wear IEMs that long because my inner ears would get itchy and uncomfortable after around one hour. Because PolarNight does not touch the ear canals, I have no itchy ears. I also found PolarNight to be more comfortable than other modern earbuds due to two factors: larger driver and lighter construction. For example, FiiO's FF series utilise smaller 14.2mm drivers, which mean they don't fit as snuggly in my ears. Combining this issue with the heavy metal construction means the earpieces would slowly slide out from the sweet spot in my ears and require adjustment. The thick stems of PolarNight and the way they sit closer to the ears compared to the classical MX5 shells commonly used by DIYers, so I found that PolarNight locks into place better and requires less adjustment. All in all, it has been a smooth ride. 

The sound is where things get a bit complicated. 

Out of the box experience was not stellar. The first song I listened to PolarNight was Shivers by Ed Sheeran and it was, for the lack of a better word, *brutal*. When Ed reached high notes, I found myself winching. You might think that it is sibilance (a.k.a., that piercing hiss that you hear when singers pronouce "s," "sh," "th," "f," "z," or "v,"), but that's not the case. In fact, PolarNight tames the 5-8kHz region quite well and is quite less "hot" in this region than other AFUL IEMs. No, it's the energy in the upper midrange region around 3-4kHz region that is a bit out of balance. It means when singers stay in the lower register, everything is find and dandy. However, when they reach higher notes, you will find those higher notes just a bit louder than expected and thus a bit uncomfortable. If you recall, one of AFUL's design goal was to lift this region. So in that sense, you might say "job well done."

So, is it the end to AFUL's earbuds ambition? It would be if I stopped listening right then, but it would be premature and the tonality seems promising with instrumental music, so I pressed on. 

After a few more songs, I'm used to the more intense upper midrange and it is no longer a problem. Despite the initial shock with the upper midrange, I found that midrange as a whole is still natural and pleasing as one would expect from AFUL. I think the lower midrange prevented this tuning from becoming a trainwreck. Simply put, despite having an emphasis on the upper midrange, PolarNight does not make voices hollow because it has enough lower midrange to balance out. I find myself enjoying the classics from Johnny Cash and Marty Robbins with PolarNight quite a bit because this earbuds make their voices sound natural, with authority. For these gentlemen, the upper midrange emphasis of PolarNight highlights the texture and details in their voices in a way that makes recordings sound "high-resolution." Even tape hiss sounds more "real" somehow. 

Another evidence for the success of PolarNight's tuning is how it handles pianos, cellos, and orchestras. Usually, when we deal with a hollow midrange (like the ones usually provided by "full-Harman" IEMs), cellos would lose authority and start to sound like violas, and pianos would sound hollow and imbalance. It was not the case
