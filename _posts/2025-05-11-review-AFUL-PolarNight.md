In the age of wireless technology and minituarised computers, it seems nothing can be more archaic than wired IEMs and big bulky MP3 players that audiophiles love so much. But what if I tell you that thre is yet another niche within this niche of a hobby? 

Enter the flathead earbuds.

Do you remember the godawful earphones back in the days of cassette tapes, CDs, and early iPods? The ones that have big flat heads that just hanging outside the ear canals rather than going all the way in like *In-ear* Monitor (IEMs)? Yes, those are flathead earbuds. When IEMs dominate the personal audio market, it is easy to believe that they have killed off the earbuds for good. Surprisingly, they have been hanging around, being lowkey in the background, cherished by a small and passionate commmunity, away from the warp-speed of the "ChiFi" IEM market. Do-it-yourself community (DIYers) and manufacturers like Venture Electronics, FiiO, Dunu, NiceHck kept the form factor alive and pushed the boundary. 

And you know what? Earbuds have improved. A lot. In fact, when I receive some of your questions about recommendations for a new pair of IEMs, I think you are better served with a pair of modern earbuds instead. You want a wide, open soundstage? Earbuds. You want to avoid the annoying pressure build up in ear canals? Earbuds. You want that new and fancy "bone conduction" effect where the soundwave hits your ear conchas in addition to the ear drums? Earbuds. So on and so forth.

Today, let's have a look at PolarNight and see whether the stellar IEM maker AFUL has what it takes to push the earbuds technology forward.


Forewords

- What I look for in an IEM is **immersion.** I want to feel the orchestra around my head, track individual instruments, and hear all of their textures and details. I'm not picky about tonality, as long as it does not make the orchestra, violin, cellos, and pianos sound wrong.
- I rate IEMs within with a consistent scale from **1 (Poor) to 3 (Good) to 5 (Outstanding)**. An overall ranking of 3/5 or above is considered positive.

By now, I think us geeks in the personal audio community have developed quite an expectation when we look at a new release from AFUL because, let's face it, this Chinese audio boutique has not released a single dud since their first international release, the Performer 5 hybrid IEM. So, what does AFUL brings to the flathead earbuds table? 

First, let's talk spec sheet. PolarNight is powered by an in-house 15.4mm driver with 32ohm impedance and sensitivity of 108dB/mW @ 1kHz. This driver size is larger than the 14.8mm and 14.2mm drivers used by other manufacturers, meaning PolarNight would fill the concha area of your ears more fully, which could be better or worse depending on the structure of your ears. The earpieces are constructed from a combination of metal and resin components and support replaceable cables via MMCX connector. 

If you have been following AFUL, I guess your question so far would be: "Everything seems pretty standard. Where is AFUL's usual geekery?" That was also my first question when hearing about PolarNight. AFUL's answer starts from taking a step back and looking at the entire landscape of flathead earbuds to understand their perenial weaknesses, and used these as the starting point of the design process. In particular, AFUL went after three key limitations:

1. **Lack of sub-bass and weak bass response in general.** This lack of bass leads to an unrefined low-end response.
2. **Lack of vocal expressiveness.** In particular, the 15.4mm drivers and 14.2mm drivers used by flatheads earbuds tend to concentrate most of the energy around the 500Hz-2kHz region, neglecting the lower-midrange (down to 250Hz) and upper midrange (up to 4kHz), As a result, voices tend to sound boxy, lacking the right kind of warmth and the right kind of vibrancy.
3. **Limited soundstage height and resolution.** This limitation is caused by a combination of the overly concentrated response in the midrange region, poor treble extension, and limitations of the large full-ranged drivers in general.

The general directions that AFUL took to address these problems are pretty much the same path that DIYers and other manufacturers have been pursuing: improving the driver, and fine-tuning the acoustic structures to squeeze the most out of that driver whilst masking its problems. For the driver, AFUL uses an in-house 15.4mm driver containing a PET+PU diaphragm driven by N52 magnets and copper-clad aluminium voice coil. The drive is house in a metal cavity, which is attached to a resin structure that contains 3D printed channels for dampening the driver and amplifying bass response. If you feel a bit of deja vu, you are not alone. We are seeing the same design principle, enabled by the same high-precision 3D printing capability that we have have been in almost every AFUL's release so far. 

If we are more specific, the system that AFUL implemented this time in PolarNight is called "Dual-Resonance, Dual-Damping Amplitude Control System." As the name implies, PonarNight has two sets of vents. The first one, called Resonance Control Damping A is located in the vent holes that you can find on the metal cavity holding the driver. The other vent, called Resonance Control Damping B is at the top of the resin part of the shells, which is connected to a long resonant chamber that runs within the shells and connects to the empty "room" at the back of the driver. This B vent is closed with a foam, which you can pull out and replace. AFUL provides a bag of spare foams, and if you are adventurous and handy with a pair of tweezers, no one stops you from experimenting with different damping foams.


Experience
===

But enough with the specsheet and theory. How does it feel to use PolarNight? 

To answer this question, I have used PolarNight as my daily driver perhaps for over a month, perhaps much longer than anticipated by both Hifigo/AFUL and myself. I spent around six to seven hours a day, 5 days a week with these earbuds in my ears to provide background music at work. The comfort, as you might have guessed based on the long hour, is stellar. I have not been able to wear IEMs that long because my inner ears would get itchy and uncomfortable after around one hour. Because PolarNight does not touch the ear canals, I have no itchy ears. I also found PolarNight to be more comfortable than other modern earbuds due to two factors: larger driver and lighter construction. For example, FiiO's FF series utilise smaller 14.2mm drivers, which mean they don't fit as snuggly in my ears. Combining this issue with the heavy metal construction means the earpieces would slowly slide out from the sweet spot in my ears and require adjustment. The thick stems of PolarNight and the way they sit closer to the ears compared to the classical MX5 shells commonly used by DIYers, so I found that PolarNight locks into place better and requires less adjustment. All in all, it has been a smooth ride. 

The sound is where things get a bit complicated. 

Out of the box experience was not stellar. The first song I listened to PolarNight was Shivers by Ed Sheeran and it was, for the lack of a better word, *brutal*. When Ed reached high notes, I found myself winching. You might think that it is sibilance (a.k.a., that piercing hiss that you hear when singers pronouce "s," "sh," "th," "f," "z," or "v,"), but that's not the case. In fact, PolarNight tames the 5-8kHz region quite well and is quite less "hot" than other AFUL IEMs. No, it's the energy in the upper midrange region around 3-4kHz region that is a bit out of balance. It means when singers stay in the lower register, everything is find and dandy. However, when they reach higher notes, you will find those higher notes just a bit louder than expected and thus a bit uncomfortable. If you recall, one of AFUL's design goal was to lift this region. So in that sense, you might say "job well done."

So, is it the end to AFUL's earbuds ambition? It would be rather unprofessional to throw in a towel after five minutes, so I pressed on with the rest of my playlist. After all, I can always adjust the tuning further with my foam collection. So I pressed the play button and settled down.

And you know what, I'm glad I did because after a few more songs, I actually got used to the upper midrange of PolarNight to the point it was no longer a problem, and I could even see some upsides of this tuning choice. I think the lower midrange prevented this tuning from becoming a trainwreck. Simply put, despite having an emphasis on the upper midrange, PolarNight does not make voices hollow because it has enough lower midrange to balance out. I find myself enjoying the classics from Johnny Cash and Marty Robbins with PolarNight quite a bit because this earbuds make their voices sound natural, with authority. For these gentlemen, the upper midrange emphasis of PolarNight highlights the texture and details in their voices in a way that makes recordings sound "high-resolution." Even tape hiss sounds more "real" somehow. 

Another evidence for the success of PolarNight's tuning is how it handles pianos, cellos, and orchestras. Usually, when we deal with a hollow midrange (like the ones usually provided by "full-Harman" IEMs), cellos would lose authority and start to sound like violas, and pianos would sound hollow and imbalance. It was not the case here. I thoroughly enjoyed my classical library with PolarNight. 

So, what's the verdict about PolarNight's tonality? I find it more intense than what I expected. But at the same time, it never sounds unnatural, hollow, honky, or nasally. The focused energy at 3-4kHz lends an incredible sense of clarity to most voices and instruments, beside those that have already been mixed a bit too hot. All in all, I'd say PolarNight is one of the better tuned flathead earbuds, but somewhat a regression on the tuning front within the AFUL's family. 

Let's move on from tonality to the agglomerate of sonic characteristics known as "technical performance." This is where PolarNight shines the brightest. The best word that I can think of to convey the entire "technical performance" of PolarNight is SNAPPY. Note attacks across the frequency spectrum start with a great sense of incisiveness. No delay, no hesitation, no blurriness, no "loosey goosey". When many note attacks appear very close to each other, such as in a busy section or a quick bassline, those attacks remain crisp and distinct. It's not a grossly exaggerated claim to say this 15.4mm dynamic driver of PolarNight can rival the incisiveness of some high-performing full-BA setups. Yes, I did my A/B tests. 

This incisiveness of PolarNight creates tangible benefits to my listening experience. In the midrange region, the incisiveness leads to a great sense of clarity and separation (i.e., the so-called "macro resolution"). It means in most busy recordings, I can separate and follow any instrument or voice with little effort. When I sit back and listen to the whole, I can hear individual parts rather than a homogeneous blob of sound. You would think that the wide open soundstage of earbuds play a major role in this advantage and it would be true. However, if a pair of earbuds is not incisive enough (like most of my DIY buds), you can hear distinct blobs that sit further from each other on the soundstage, yet you still have a hard time distinguishing instruments within each blob. Combining the great instrument separation with the "forced clarity" baked into PolarNight's upper midrange emphasis, and you quite a "high-resolution" sonic picture. 

In the bass region, the incisiveness of PolarNight leads to tactile and snappy bass line. AFUL's effort in improving the bass response paid dividends here as PolarNight provides just enough amount of bass and even subbass to create a sense of power behind every bass attacks. Large drums in OST of the Ghost of Tsushima such as "The Fate of Tsushima" feel large, "tight", with a great sense of power and "realness." I also like to revisit classics from Bon Jovi because the way PolarNight renders the drums. It's toe-tapping, exhilarating, and makes me forget about life for a while. Anyway, I digressed.

Stereo imaging is another area where PolarNight does very well. Yes, most earbuds sound very wide and open because they do not block the ear canals. But at the same time, they don't position instruments within this large soundstage with finesse because they tend to lack treble extension. It was not the case with PolarNight. I noticed its precision the first time when listening to an ASMR video recorded with a Neumann KU100. PolarNight was so precise that I can detect subtle shifts in height, angle, an distance of the sound. This level of precision nearly matches my daily driver IEM, the AFUL Cantor. Morever, due to the earbuds form factor, the sound sources can be appear further from my head with PolarNight, so I would say PolarNight reproduced the ASMR track even more accurately than Cantor here.

Where PolarNight falters in on the stereo imaging aspect is the perception of depth, especially of the sound coming from the front of the head. I tested its capability in FPS gaming and found myself a bit disappointed. Whilst the sounds from the sides and back have great positioning that I can easily detect distant, height, and angle, the sounds from the front feel like they are on the same plane that is very close to the face. In other words, PolarNight does not provide me that orbital soundstage that acts as a "radar" like some IEMs. I suspect a bit extra bass response could help.

Before moving on, conclude our discussion with modding. I guess your burning question now is "if you whine about the upper midrange that much, why don't you just change the foam?" For dear readers who have not seen modern earbuds before, let me provide a quick explanation: whilst earbuds can be worn as-is ("naked"), most put a layer of foams or silicone rings on the driver. Foams dampen sound and improve the seal between earbuds and the ears, so foams play a significant role in the tuning of earbuds. AFUL paired PolarNight with "Donut" foams, which have a hole in the middle for the sound to come through unimpeded. Of course we can replace donut foams with full foams to dampen the high end and increase the perceived amount of low-end. However, I found that all of my full foam does not provide enough change in the upper midrange whilst dampening the snappy response of PolarNight in the bass region. When I measured the response of PolarNight, I detected a slight drop in bass response at the same level of input signal. Moreover, because my ears got used to the upper midrange of PolarNight, I found foam swap unnecessary. Of course, my ears are not your ears, so it does not hurt to try a foam swap if you can.

Selected Comparisons
===
 
![](/assets/images/AFUL-PolarNight/PolarNight_graph_vsFF3.jpg)

**PolarNight vs FiiO FF3:** These buds couldn't be more different. FF3 has smaller driver and very heavy metal shells, so I constantly have to adjust it in my ears. Meanwhile, PolarNight has larger driver and better fitting shells. In terms of sound, FF3 is tuned towards a bassy, warm(er) sound signature whilst PolarNight is tuned more "neutral." Both earbuds have outstanding bass quality, but they approach the bass response in different ways. FF3 gives you a big, bold, "woolly" bass response that give the impression that the bass come from a larger source, with a stronger "air pushed against ears" sensation. PolarNight is more agile, tactile, and snappy in its bass response. FF3 has better forward positioning of the sound and just a better illusion of soundstage depth in general. PolarNight has superior clarity, resolution, and precision of stereo imaging on the sides channels. All in all, I think FF3 is still quite competitive against PolarNight and you can have both as they go for different sound signature.

![](/assets/images/AFUL-PolarNight/PolarNight_graph_vsFF5.jpg)

**PolarNight vs FiiO FF5:** On paper, a less bassy and more agile version of FF3 would be the perfect counter to PolarNight. In practice, FF5 is not competitive. I tested FF5 with various types of foams and silicone rings but I always found it to sound more hollow than PolarNight. For example, when I listen to The Last Recordings by John Denver, with FF5, I found John's voice to be the dominant element in the mix yet his voice sound a bit thin. Switching to PolarNight immediate makes the recordings become lively, as the band and the bass guitar fill in more around John's voice, and his voice has more weight and warmth. Unless you prefer a thin, focused midrange, I have to give this round to PolarNight.

![](/assets/images/AFUL-PolarNight/PolarNight_graph_vsAlpha3.jpg)

**PolarNight vs Dunu Alpha 3:** Alpha 3 puts up a much better fight. In terms of the tonality, both IEMs render John Denver's voice almost identically. All of my complaints about upper midrange of PolarNight can be applied directly to Alpha 3 (and vice versa, to be fair). Where PolarNight pulls ahead is the richness of the mix and the quality of the bass response. Similar to FF5, Alpha 3 focuses on the midrange, perhaps at the expense of other parts of the spectrum. Whilst Alpha 3 can put up a decent fight against PolarNight in more easy going recordings, it completely lacks the impact and power to come close to PolarNight's performance in energetic tracks like The Fate of Tsushima. Alpha 3 is simply boring in these recordings and no amount of my foam swapping managed to change the situation. 

![](/assets/images/AFUL-PolarNight/PolarNight_graph_vsSerratus.jpg)

**PolarNight vs Serratus:** First thing first: Serratus is significantly more difficult to drive than PolarNight. I need to turn my R6 Pro Max player to 42 with Serratus to have the same loudness level as PolarNight at 31. In terms of sonic performance, it is surprisingly how closely Serratus match PolarNight in terms of bass response. Whilst Serratus loses out slightly in terms of snappiness of the bass attacks, it offers a thicker, more muscular midbass and lower midrange. Serratus is also noticeably more "trebly" than PolarNight, which helps with conveying the position cues and ambience baked into large orchestral recordings. I would say Serratus convey a grander stereo images with Ghost of Tsushima OSTs. However, the "trebly" tuning of Serratus is also its Achilles' heel. Simply put, it's can be sibilant. John Denver, for example, sounds more pleasant with PolarNight. Other than tonality, Serratus trades blow with PolarNight on every aspect of technical performance. 

One interesting observation: Serratus' tuning feels more like AFUL's house sound (restrained upper midrange, pushing treble to limit) than AFUL's own earbuds.

**PolarNight vs Performer5+2 (P7):** You ask "why?" I say "why not?" The first differences are, of course, the level of noise isolation P7 offers and the fact that the whole soundstage feels more tightly packed. I also feel myself breath out a sign of relief when putting P7 on because this is the level of upper midrange that I feel at home. But after this impression, I'm surprised to find that I miss the clarity and incisiveness of PolarNight, particularly in the midrange region. The bassline of PolarNight is also more snappy and tight, whilst P7 is sounds thicker and more "muscular." On the plus side for P7, it indeed has superior treble response, evidenced by the nice sense of ambience and space it conveys in Ghost of Tsushima OST album. All in all, I'm still amazed by the technical performance of these 15.4mm drivers AFUL put in PolarNight.

Conclusions
===

As I concluded my (very) long assessment of PolarNight, the conclusion is pretty clear to me: these are some special earbuds. Yes, the tonality has some hiccups but that's not uncommon or particularly problematic in the earbuds world. Where AFUL makes their mark with PolarNight is the technical performance. It's not everyday I can find earbuds that are competitive on the technical performance and even bass quality against good IEMs. In fact, it wouldn't be exaggerated to say that PolarNight stands at the forefront of mass-produced earbuds. 

But here is the elephant in the room: the DIYers. Whilst PolarNight cruised through my A/B tests against mass-produced earbuds, it faced quite a tough competition against some of the more prominent DIY earbuds. So, the question for your, as a consumer, is whether you should go with top notch factory-made earbuds where you arguably have a higher degree of consistency or test your luck with hand-made-in-small-batch earbuds. Only you and your priorities can answer this question. In any case, AFUL PolarNight, and the earbuds form factor as a whole, receive a high recommendation from this reviewer.
