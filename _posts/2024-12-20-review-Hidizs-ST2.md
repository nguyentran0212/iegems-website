Today, we look at a new release from Hidizs, the ST2 Pro Nebula. This IEM is an attempt to combine Hidizs expertise as an electronics manufacturer with their emerging reputation as an IEM maker. 

Forewords
===

- What I look for in an IEM is **immersion.** I want to feel the orchestra around my head, track individual instruments, and hear all of their textures and details. I'm not picky about tonality, as long as it does not make the orchestra, violin, cellos, and pianos sound wrong.
- I rate IEMs within with a consistent scale from **1 (Poor) to 3 (Good) to 5 (Outstanding)**. An overall ranking of 3/5 or above is considered positive. 
- Ranking list and measurement database are onÂ [my IEM review blog](https://iegems.nk-tran.com/).
- The terminology for subjective impressions in this review is based on the Audio Wheel for reproduced sound defined in the technical report [ITU-R BS.2399-0](https://www.itu.int/pub/R-REP-BS.2399)
- **This review is based on a pre-production sample from Hidizs (Thank you!).** I have no affiliation with or financial interest in Hidizs.
- This IEM would be released on Kickstarter. The campaign would be launched in December 2024 and units would be shipped in February 2025. The early bird price of the IEM is $39.

The earpieces of ST2 are definitely designed for cost-effectiveness. It consists of two injection molded plastic pieces snapped and glued together to form a hollow shell for the driver. On the plus side, the nozzles are constructed from metal and feature a lip to help retaining the ear tips. 

Comfort-wise, I had quite a bit of problem with the stock silicone ear tips that come with my pre-production unit. Simply put, the short and soft ear tips do not work well with the relatively short nozzles of ST2, making it quite tricky to achieve a stable seal. For IEMs like ST2, in my experience, you should use ear tips with a longer stem and sticky nozzles to compenstate for the nozzle length. I opted for Pentaconn Coreir AL ear tips for the rest of my listening tests with ST2.

ST2 has a rather unique sound signature that does not align with any other IEM in my database. The best way to describe it is a bass-focused V-shaped sound signature. In other words, ST2 is unabashedly "casual." It does not aim for a "neutral" "audiophile-approved" tuning nor does it aim for a sub-bass focused tuning so that "you can feel the bass without bass bleed." No, this IEM embraces mid-bass and utilises a surprisingly capable dynamic driver to execute that vision. ST2 is punchy, thumpy, and unabashedly recessed and boomy. 

At the same time, Hidizs shows restrain and maturity with the tuning of the other end of the spectrum. As a result, ST2's upper midrange and treble are *generally* smooth with minimal sibilance or shoutiness. The benefit of this tuning choice is that you can turn the volume even louder to soak in that mid-bass *boom boom*. 


**Percussion, Bass, and perceived dynamic:**

Bass response, particularly mid-bass, is the highlight of ST2 sound signature. The frequency response of ST2 ensures that the sounds listeners commonly associate with "bass" such as kick drums and the slaps and plucks of bass guitars are highlighted over other elements in the mix. The exaggerated amount of bass is accompanied by surprisingly competent bass quality to create impactful bass line that also feels "tight" and snappy. The only aspect where the bass of ST2 falters is the sub-bass extension. Simply put, this IEM does not "growl" or "rumble" as much as you would expect when you compare to modern IEMs with a sustained boost below 50Hz. As a result, if your music relies on sub-bass rather than mid-bass, you might find the bass somewhat lacking. 

**Resolution:**

ST2 does not break the mold of a single DD in terms of both instrument separation and detail retrieval. Weak extension into the upper treble is an expected weakness that pulls down the perceived technical performance. The tuning choice to emphasise bass and recess the midrange also negatively impact the perceived clarity of this IEM. That said, ST2 does not fall behind the expected level of good DD from yester-years such as the venerable Moondrop Aria 2021. The snappy, tactile physical sensation from the bass also gives this IEM a slight boost in the *perceived* incisiveness. 


**Stereo imaging and soundstage:**

The soundstage of ST2 is rather unusual, due to its tuning.

Driveability
===

NX8 is relatively easy to drive. It requires a few extra volume notches compared to easy-to-drive IEMs like AFUL Performer5+2, but it's not difficult enough to cause any problem for a small DAP like HiBy R3II. I did not hear substantial "scaling" when moving from smaller DAP to larger DAP and desktop DAC/amp setup besides a slight improvement in soundstage size. 

_____

Comparisons
===


**Vs AFUL Performer5+2 (P7):**

- Despite having identical graphs, NX8 sounds like a bass-focused IEM whilst P7 sounds more open and "lighter". 
- The midrange *tonal balance* of P7 and NX8 are nearly identical. That said, the timbre of the midrange of P7 and NX8 are different. I found that NX8 lacks some richness and density in the midrange. This phenomenon is particularly noticeable with cellos and male vocals. 
- The bass of NX8 sounds thicker and with seemingly longer decay, whilst P7 sounds more "bouncy" and elastic. The amount of bass is quite similar, but the "slower" bass of NX8 makes it feels more bassy, if not slightly "bleeding" over the midrange.
- P7 has an advantage when it comes to overall clarity and detail retrieval.
- The soundstage of P7 spreads out more and feels more open than that of NX8.

Conclusions
===


**What I like about this IEM:**

- Indulgent, thick bass response
- Comfortable fit due to small shells and small nozzles
- Good tonal balance and overall technical performance to complement the bass

**What could be improved:**

- The soundstage could be more spread out and open to take advantage of the good imaging
- Printed faceplates do not stand up well to closer inspection
