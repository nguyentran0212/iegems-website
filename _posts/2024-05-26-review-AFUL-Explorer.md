Opening phrase

Forewords
===

- What I look for in an IEM is **immersion.** I want to feel the orchestra around my head, track individual instruments, and hear all of their textures and details. I'm not picky about tonality, as long as it is not make the orchestra, violin, cellos, and pianos sound wrong.
- I rate IEMs within with a consistent scale from **1 (Poor) to 3 (Good) to 5 (Outstanding)**. An overall ranking of 3/5 or above is considered positive. 
- Ranking list and measurement database are on [my IEM review blog](https://iegems.nk-tran.com/).
- Terms used in my reviews are consistent with the [glossary by Headphonesty](https://www.headphonesty.com/sound-description-glossary)
- **This review is based on a review sample from Hifigo (Thank you!).** I have no affiliation with or financial interest in Hifigo and AFUL. 
- The unit retails for $119 at the time this review was published.

General Information
===

- AFUL Explorer is a 3-driver, hybrid IEM. It has two balanced armature (BA) drivers, handling the mid and high frequencies, and one 8mm dynamic driver (DD) that handles the bass. 
- AFUL Explorer implements a 3-way electronic and acoustic crossover design. The incoming electric signal is split across three drivers by a crossover circuit (AFUL calls this circuit "RLC Network Frequency Division") and each driver conducts sound by an independent sound tube. 
- The BA drivers are custom design that was first introduced in the Magic One, the previous IEM from AFUL. 
- The sound tubes are 3D printed, featuring coils and curves to precisely control the air volume inside the tube for both sound dampening and to take advantage of Helmholtz resonance to control the frequency response of the drivers.
- In general, this IEM has interesting technologies. How does it sound? Let's find out. 


Non-sound Aspects
===

**Packaging and accessories:**

- The box of AFUL Explorer is quite small and simple. 
- In the box, there is foam with custom cut-outs to keep the earpieces and accessories. 
- There is a small, round carrying case provided in the box
- There are six sets of generic silicone ear tips
- There is a nice IEM cable with a 2 wire design. In my unit, the cable terminates with a 4.4mm jack. You can also buy the version with 3.5mm jack. My only complaint with the cable is that the ear hooks on the cable are quite aggressive, pinching the ears hard and make the back of my ears a bit uncomfortable after a while. 

**Ear pieces design:** 

- The earpieces are 3D printed from a plastic material, polished to a smooth and shiny finish. 
- The earpieces have the shape of Custom IEMs (CIEM), making them locking into the ears more stable. They are also smaller than other IEM earpieces that feature a CIEM shape. 
- Because the earpieces are constructed from plastic, they are very lightweight. 
- The earpieces have 2-pin connector to connect with the cable. This connector sits flush against the earpieces. 
- At the bottom of the IEM there is a vent hole for releasing the pressure from the dynamic driver.
- Similarly to all previous IEMs from AFUL, the Explorer also has narrow nozzles with moderate length. 

**Fit, comfort and isolation:**

- AFUL Explorer is very comfortable thanks to the small and light earpieces and narrower nozzles. 
- Noise isolation is actually good. I can use this IEM on bus or when walking next to a busy main street. 

**Ear tips recommendation:** 

- I recommend ear tips that allow for deeper fit, so that the earpieces rest firmly against the concha of the ears. 
- I personally use Tri Clarion ear tips.

**Timbre, tonality, and tonal balance:** *Figure shows the frequency response of XXXX against the Harman in-ear target. Measurements were done with an IEC-711-compliant coupler and might only be compared with other measurements from this same coupler. Above 8kHz, the measurement might not be correct. Visit my [graph database](https://nk-tran.com/iegems-graphtool/) for more comparisons.*

*It is helpful to think of an IEM as a filter that highlights or subdues different parts of the incoming audio signal. This effect can be measured objectively by the squiggly lines above, called Frequency Response (FR) graphs, which measure how loud an IEM is at different frequencies from 20Hz (bass) to 20kHz (upper treble). Subjectivity is how your ears and brain interpret the effect of that filter on your music and decide whether it is "enjoyable." There are some "rules of thumb" when it comes to tonality, but most interesting IEMs usually bend the rules masterfully.*

- The sound signature of AFUL Explorer belongs to the rare breed known as "L-shaped." It has a strong bass response, accompanied by a neutral-warm midrange response and an even treble response that extends far into the upper treble region. 
- Bass instruments such as double basses, lower strings of cellos, and trombone are highlighted whenever they appear in the mix. Fortunately, they don't overpower or cast a cloud "muffle" sensation over the rest of the mix.
- Example: when I listen to Bach's violin sonatas and partitas performed by Kavakos, I found that violin has natural timbre, perhaps with a touch more richness than usual. There was no unnaturalness. 
- Example: when I listen to the four seasons violin concerti by Vivaldi, performed by Janine Jansen and her ensemble, I did not detect any unnaturalness in any string instruments. At the same time, the low pitch rumble of cellos and basses is prominent, lending a sense of power and anchoring the performance. 
- Example: when I listen to the track "ABC (feat. Sophia Black)" in the album "Remember That You Will Die" by Polyphia, I can hear significant bass slam, yet the voice remains commendably audible and separated from the chaotic background instruments of this track. 
- The loudness of the treble varies between tracks. The treble instruments such as cymbals and hats are roughly inline with or behind the midrange instruments. The treble is smooth and detailed, not piercing or harsh. 
- My only complaint about the tonality of AFUL Explorer is that the upper midrange is perhaps a few dB too tamed for me. For example, when I listen to female vocal music such as "ABC (feat. Sophia Black)" and "Aria of the Soul" from Persona 4 OST album, I found that the voices lack a certain "shinness" and edge, as if the higher notes are a bit dull. I also have the same observation when listening to horns and trumpets. This phenomenon can be explained by the relatively subdued response of AFUL Explorer in around the 3kHz and 4kHz region. 
- In general, I still think that AFUL has done a great job with creating the L-shaped sound signature of Explorer. The tonality is pleasant, natural, and works with variety of music, whilst still giving musics a fresh presentation comparing to most IEMs that are tuned toward a similar sound signature. I rate Explorer's tonality 4/5 (Great). 

**Bass and perceived dynamic:**

**Resolution:** *To me, "resolution" can be broken down into three components: (1) Sharpness, incisiveness, or "definition" of note attacks (see the figure above). (2) The separation of instruments and vocals, especially when they overlap on the soundstage. (3) The texture and details in the decay side of the notes. The first two give music clarity and make it easy to track individual elements of a mix. The last provides music details and nuances.*

**Stereo imaging and soundstage:** *Stereo imaging or "soundstage" is a psychoacoustic illusion that different recording elements appear at various locations inside and around your head. Your brain creates based on the cues in the recording, which are enhanced or diminushed by your IEMs, your DAC, and your amplifier. In rare cases, with some specific songs, some IEMs can trick you into thinking that the sound comes from the environment (a.k.a., "holographic")*
