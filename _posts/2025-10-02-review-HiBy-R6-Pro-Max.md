Let's face it. In this day and age, we don't really *need* a Digital Audio Player (DAP) to enjoy music. Yet, it makes perfect sense that we might *want* a DAP. This begs the question: what makes a DAP "good"? Whilst you mull on this question, let's talk about the latest release from the DAP powerhouse HiBy, the brand new R6 Pro Max. 

Preambles
===
- In this review, I use the term "source" to denote a DAC+amp combo for brevity and convenience. 
- Sources do not make sounds. Therefore, when I say sources "sound" a certain way, I talk about the change they make to my IEMs and earphones. 
- I want my music to be crisp, clear, well-separated and form a 3D soundstage around my head. Sources that intensify those characteristics of my IEMs are considered "better". 
- The unit used for this review was a sample provided by HiBy (Thank you!). The unit is retailed for $999 and can be found on [HiBy web store (non-affiliated link)](https://store.hiby.com/products/hiby-r6-pro-max).

General Information 
===

R6 Pro Max is a high-end option in the late 2024 - early 2025 DAP line up of HiBy. It is the direct upgrade of the R6 Pro 2, which was released back in 2023. It should be noted that R6 Pro Max is in a different "family line" than R6 III (Gen 3), which has just received an upgraded version called R6 III 2025. 

Confusing? Yeah, I know! Since I have spent way too much time going around HiBy website to figure out what is what and how everything is related to each other, I'm going to sit you down and go through the whole list from the entry-level all the way to the Top-of-the-Line (TOTL). We will deliberately ignore the models from the "HiBy Digital" line, which is a sub-brand of HiBy focusing on experimental and budget-friendly options. 

- **R1**: this DAP runs a Linux-based operating system called HiBy OS. It features a single CS43131 DAC chip, likely operating as both a DAC and an amplifier. This DAP supports only 3.5mm output and Bluetooth.
- **R3 III 2025**: this DAP is the upgraded version of the R3 III, which was an upgrade of the long line of R3 DAP (R3, R3 Pro, R3 Pro Saber). This 2025 revision of R3 III features a new SoC, which in turn enables the DAP to run a newer version of HiBy OS. I reviewed the non-2025 version of R3 III [a while back](https://iegems.nk-tran.com/2023/09/16/review-HiBy-R3II.html).  
- **RS2**: this DAP is the entry-level model in the R2-R DAC design product line. You can read about delta-sigma modulation and R2-R DAC [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta-sigma_modulation) and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistor_ladder). Technically, R2-R is not as accurate as delta-sigma, but its inaccuracy has its own charm.
- **R4**: this is the most affordable Android-based DAP with balanced output in HiBy's line up. The audio side of R4 is powered by 4xES9018C DAC chips and class A amplifier. The Android is powered by Snapdragon 665 SoC with 3GB RAM and 32GB internal storage. I reviewed this nifty DAP [a while back](https://iegems.nk-tran.com/2024/05/04/review-HiBy-R4.html). 
- **R6 III (2025)**: R6 is arguably the most popular amongst HiBy DAPs. This mid-range DAP has 4xCS43198 DAC design and switchable class A/AB amplifier. The Android side is powered by Snapdragon 665 SoC with 4GB RAM and 64GB internal storage. Noted that the R6 III (non-2025) version is still available at a discount at the time I write this article. 
- **R6 Pro Max**: a high-end model in the product line with delta-sigma DAC design. We will talk about it in this review article. 
- **RS6**: a high-end model in the R2R DAC design product line. Interestingly, this DAP looks very similar to R6 III on the outside. Inside, RS6 is powered by in-house signal processing architecture called "Darwin", which offers quite an array of turnable options. If you are the type of listener who wants to tweak your device non-stop, this DAP might be for you. 
- **R8II**: the TOTL of the delta-sigma DAC design from HiBy. The DAC of R8II is assembled from discrete components rather than relying on all-in-one chips from ESS, AKM, and Cirrus Logic. The amplifier is again switchable between class A and class AB and features a "Turbo" mode that boost the max volage swings from 6V to 7.5V. I looked at this DAP a while back. 
- **RS8**: the TOTL model of the R2-R DAC product line. Whilst it looks like RS6 in online photos, it's comically large in real-life. If you want to sample what HiBy can do if budget is not a constraint, have a listen to this DAP. 

Phew! What a list. I hope that it clarifies the positioning of R6 Pro Max. Now, let's have a closer look at the specs of this DAP.

The audio-side of R6 Pro Max starts from **two ES9039MS Pro** DAC chips from ESS. You might recognize these DAC chips from some desktop DAC devices, such as SU-X and RAWPRO-DAC1 from SMSL. As far as I know, R6 Pro Max is the first portable device equipped with these DAC chips. The two DAC chips output into **8-way independent IV conversion**, which in turn output to low-pass filter and amplifier. The amplifier itself is built around **4 OPA1612 opamps paired with 4 ELNA capacitors**, which HiBy claims to imbue a "tube warmth" to the output. All four stages (DAC, IV conversion, LPF, and amplifier) are powered by **independent power-supply** to minimize interference. Interestingly, despite the seemingly more complex circuit design, R6 Pro Max is significantly more simple to use than its predecessor. There is no more class A/AB switching, no "turbo" mode, no Darwin filter. It's more a plug-and-play experience this time around. The specs of phone out and line out are listed below.

The Android-side of R6 Pro Max is driven by the venerable **Snapdragon 665 SoC, aided by 6GB of RAM and 128GB of internal memory**. R6 Pro Max is shipped with a very clean version of **Open Android 12**, completely devoid of Google's bloat (it means you need to do some work to get Google's services installed should you need them). You would interact with the system via a **5.9 inch 2160x1080 IPS screen**, covered in Corning Gorilla Glass and oleophobic coating. The entire system is powered by a large **8200mAh battery** that supports **40W fast charging**.

<!--- The screen sometimes hangs after waking the device from sleep. Fixable by sleeping and waking the device again.-->
<!--- Clicking on my playlist in Tidal crashed the OS.-->
<!--- Album arts must be baseline JPG. Many of my album arts do not show because they are in the progressive JPG format.-->
<!---->
<!--Sound Performance-->
<!--===-->
<!---->
<!--**Neutral tonality:** R3II does not add warmth or thickness to the midrange. It does not add the usual glare and brightness that some ESS-based dongles tend to have.-->
<!---->
<!--**Light note weight:** The midbass seems more quiet with R3II in direct comparison against most dongles and DAPs in my collection. The subbass is still presented properly, so R3II is still dynamic and impactful when the music calls for, but it is not weighty.-->
<!---->
<!--**Detailed:** detail retrieval across the frequency is strong. To put in context, the detail of R3II is quite close to Chord Mojo2 and DX300. -->
<!---->
<!--**Soundstage**: when playing spacious orchestral recordings with good IEM, the gap between R3II and the previous generation and some dongles are quite clear. R3II can present proper space between instruments and the listeners, as well as between the instruments themselves. There is also a strong separation between foreground and background. Simply put, whilst R3II does not match a desktop setup or a TOTL DAP like DX300, it does not limit the staging performance of my good IEMs to an unacceptable level that I usually experience with dongles and micro DAPs.-->
<!---->
<!--**Handling Low-impedance, low-sensitivity IEM (E5000):** R3II did a decent job. However, E5000 sounds noticeably small and more congested with R3II comparing to DX300.-->
<!---->
<!--**Handling high-impedance transducers (TGXear Serratus, 300ohm):** The gap between R3II and DX300 was smaller than the E5000 pairing. It seems that R3II has problem with current delivery rather than voltage. -->
<!---->
<!--Conclusion-->
<!--===-->
<!---->
<!--I admit: I didn't have much expectation when I heard about R3II. However, the device quickly won me over with the portability and sound quality. No, this tiny box does not offer the sound quality that makes my DX300 redundant. However, it does not hinder the soundstage performance of my IEMs significantly whilst being much more compact and pocketable. And that's what a micro DAP should do.  -->
<!---->
<!--**Absolute Sonic Performance:** 3/5 - Good.-->
<!--**Bias score**: 4/5 - I am happy to add this device to my rotation.-->
<!---->
<!--**Pros:**-->
<!--- Size-->
<!--- Price-->
<!--- Battery-->
<!--- Good detail retrieval-->
<!--- No significant compromise in soundstage-->
<!---->
<!--**Cons:**-->
<!--- Audio latency over AAC connection-->
<!--- Album art compatibility issue-->
