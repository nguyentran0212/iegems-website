To me, there has always been something alluring about the idea of "tribrid" IEMs, the ones that use a combination of three different types of drivers. No, featuring a tribrid design does not guarantee that an IEM would be exceptional. I like to think of a tribrid design as the potential to be exceptional, but whether that potential is realised is another matter entirely. Thus, tribrid IEMs sometimes feel like pricy lottery tickets in the audio world. Previously, Simgot has been able to bring quadbrid design down to the $135 price tag. This time, they continue to push the envelope by bringing tribrid down to $70 bracket. Did they succeed? Read on to find out, my friends. 

Forewords
===

- What I look for in an IEM is **immersion.** I want to feel the orchestra around my head, track individual instruments, and hear all of their textures and details. I'm not picky about tonality, as long as it is not make the orchestra, violin, cellos, and pianos sound wrong.
- I rate IEMs within with a consistent scale from **1 (Poor) to 3 (Good) to 5 (Outstanding)**. An overall ranking of 3/5 or above is considered positive. 
- Ranking list and measurement database are on [my IEM review blog](https://iegems.nk-tran.com/).
- The terminology for subjective impressions in this review is based on the Audio Wheel for reproduced sound defined in the technical report [ITU-R BS.2399-0](https://www.itu.int/pub/R-REP-BS.2399)
- **This review is based on a review sample from Simgot (Thank you Betty @ Simgot!).** I have no affiliation with or financial interest in Simgot.

General Information
===

EW300 is a 3-driver, tribrid IEM. Its driver topology includes a 10mm dynamic driver (DD), a 6mm planar mangetic driver, and a piezoelectric driver (PZT). I couldn't find the precise information regarding the crossover design, but it is likely a 3-way design with the DD handling bass and midrange, the 6mm planar driver handling the lower- and mid-treble, and the PZT handling the upper treble. The design and placement of the PZT driver seem identical to that of SuperMix4. This driver fills in the upper treble by vibrating the entire shells from behind the faceplate, making it sort of a "bone conduction driver."

Readers with a strong attention to details would likely realise that EW300's driver topology is almost identical to that of SuperMix4, besides missing the BA driver. I was surprised to find that the planar driver was also swapped from the "rectangular" variety found in Astell & Kern Zero 1 and Zero 2 IEMs to a miniaturised 6mm planar driver. This driver sits right in front of the 10mm dynamic driver, and you can see it when you remove the nozzles of EW300. The swap of planar driver suggests that the crossover design was also modified. 

Before we move on, let's talk about the confusing product line of EW300. By the time this review was written, there are three versions of EW300:

- EW300 standard edition ($69.99): Simple, no frill version. 
- EW300 HBB edition ($75.99): A retuned version of the standard edition, made in collaboration with the IEM reviewer HBB. 
- EW300 DSP edition ($79.99): The standard edition packaged with a DSP cable rather than the usual IEM cable. This DSP cable can be thought of as a USB DAC/amp in the form of an IEM cable. There is an EQ profile baked in the DAC chip, meaning the sound of any IEM attached to this cable would change slightly. 

All three versions offer two types of interchangeable nozzles to change the sound signature of the IEM. Simgot also provide acoustic foams that you can stuff into the nozzles to further fine-tune the sound to your preference. This dizzying array of versions and customisation makes reading and writing reviews of EW300 quite challenging. In this review, I'll focus on the standard and DSP edition.

Non-sound Aspects
===

**Packaging and accessories** The packaging is rather simplistic and features usual Simgot accessories: the soft and thin cable, the silicone ear tips with wide bore and thick core, and a small carrying case. You would also find a set of silver nozzles with red o-rings (already installed on the IEMs) and a set of golden nozzles with pink o-rings. Interestingly, Simgot also provides 4 sets of spare o-rings and 3 sets of acoustic foams for stuffing into the nozzles. In general, I can't complain much about the accessories pack given the low price tag, but I do wish that Simgot offers more exotic ear tips and replace the flimsy and tangly cable with something more robust. 

**Ear pieces design** The design of EW300 is rather whimsical and stylish that somehow reminds me of albums by Ed Sheeran. The visual design of EW300 centers around the X and heart symbol, which are engraved on the faceplates of the earpieces. The earpieces themselves are quite small as they share the shape of previous releases in the EW line. The nozzles are medium in width but unfortunately quite short, so I had a bit of problem getting these IEMs to fit consistently with the stock ear tips. 

There are three color options for you to choose when ordering EW300:

- Chrome: shiny with mirror-like finished, which is a fingerprint and scratch magnet. 
- Black: the earpieces have a mate black coating that feels very similar to the material used on professional DSLR cameras. The heart and X logos on the earpieces have a polished finish for added contrast. In general, a very handsome design. 
- Grey: similar to the black design, but the heart and X logos have a chrome finish. 

**Fit, comfort and isolation** As I mentioned, the earpieces of EW300 are quite small and the nozzles are short, so I have some difficulty getting the IEM to fit properly. With the right ear tips, I found the fit to be stable and comfortable. Noise isolation is similar to other vented IEMs. I did not experience driver flex nor pressure build up.

**Ear tips recommendation:** In order to get a good fit with short nozzles, my strategy is to extend the length of the nozzles by opting for longer and more flexible ear tips. I opted for the stock nozzles of Juzear 61T, which are very similar to SpinFit W1.

The subjective impression is captured using the lexicon in the Sound Wheel below. I'll clarify the terminology as I use them. If you want to see more details of the lexicon and related reference, please have a look at the technical report [ITU-R BS.2399-0](https://www.itu.int/pub/R-REP-BS.2399).

**Timbre:**  *It is helpful to think of an IEM as a filter that highlights or subdues different parts of the incoming audio signal. This effect can be measured objectively by the squiggly lines below, called Frequency Response (FR) graphs, which measure how loud an IEM is at different frequencies from 20Hz (bass) to 20kHz (upper treble). Subjectivity is how your ears and brain interpret the effect of that filter on your music and decide whether it is "enjoyable." There are some "rules of thumb" when it comes to tonality, but most interesting IEMs usually bend the rules masterfully.*

*Figure shows the frequency response of EW300 standard and DSP editions against the Harman in-ear target. Measurements were done with an IEC-711-compliant coupler and might only be compared with other measurements from this same coupler. Above 8kHz, the measurement likely does not match the response at the ear drum. Visit my [graph database](https://nk-tran.com/iegems-graphtool/) for more comparisons.*

Overview of the timbre and tonal balance, with reference to the frequency response. Use the terminology of sound wheel.
- Timbral balance: dark-bright, full, homogeneous
- Midrange: nasal? canny? strength?
- Treble: brilliance, tinny? treble strength?
- Bass: bass strength? depth? boomy? boxy?

Let's discuss each variation of EW300 separately to reduce confusions:
- *EW300 standard edition with silver nozzles (RED o-ring):* This IEM has a **neutral-warm tonality** that is quite pleasing to the ears, with thicker lower midrange and less emphasised upper midrange. It means voices and instruments sound fuller, richer, and the higher notes are not as emphasised, leading to a more gentle and "musical" presentation. This tuning is quite a departure from the usual Simgot house sound and surprisingly quite close to one of my favourite tonal profiles, utilised by 7th Acoustics Supernova and Juzear 61T. It should be noted that this sound signature is still within the realm of "neutral" rather than overly thick and warm. 
- *EW300 standard edition with golden nozzles (PINK o-ring):* The tonal balance of EW300 is tilted towards the bass and lower midrange frequencies. The midrange instruments and voices take a step back from the soundstage, away from the listener and buried underneath the bass energy. I find this tuning too **recessed and muffled**, making it my least favourite across all options. 
- *EW300 DSP edition with silver nozzles (RED o-ring):* Comparing to the standard edition, the DSP has a thinner and arguably more neutral midrange. The midrange of EW300 DSP is **nearly identical to that of the EA1000**, meaning it is thicker and richer than full Harman IEMs, including Simgot's own SuperMix4. Interestingly, Simgot also significantly reduce the mid-treble energy around 8kHz to reduce the harshness that some listeners reported with EA1000 and SuperMix4. That said, I found that the region between 3kHz and 5kHz stands out more with the DSP version, leading to some rare instances of sharpness when I listen to sibilant and harsh recordings. 
- *EW300 DSP edition with golden nozzles (PINK o-ring):* This version of EW300 has **a neutral-with-bass-boost, leaning towards L-shaped signature**. The overal presentation somewhat similar to 61T, though the midrange sits further back in the soundstage, behind the bass. In general, it's a fun and interesting sound signature that is quite usable comparing to standard edition. 

<!-- Next, let's discuss how XXXX present various types of voices and instruments in some test tracks. The first track is [Shivers by Ed Sheeran](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2_Lrg6rRks), which is invaluable for checking the harshness and sibilance of an IEM, as well as its balance across the midrange frequencies. An IEM with ideal tonal balance would be able to control the harshness (e.g., starting from the chorus section) and imbue an emotive "warmth" to Ed's voice without making it muted or muffled. Here are key observations about how XXXX performs with this track:
- 

The next track is [Kiwi wa Boku ni Niteiru by See-Saw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6BkF23UPbM), which is an excellent song to test the ability of an IEM to handle female vocals in "weeb musics." An IEM with ideal tonal balance should be able to make the voice of Chiaki Ishikawa bright and clear, while maintaining enough energy in the lower midrange to avoid making the voice thin and harsh (a common problem with many IEMs with too much upper midrange boost). Here are key observations about how XXXX performs with this track:
- 

The next track is [Now We Are Free by 2CELLOS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74CYIdYoQ5w), which assesses an IEM's ability to render lower-midrange, particularly cellos. An IEM with ideal tonal balance should render cellos with a thick and authoritative tone and be able to reproduce the low pitch resonance and "rumble" of the cello body. At the same time, it must avoid cutting the upper midrange and treble to the point of making the cellos sound muffled, muddy, or lacking clear articulation. Here are key observations about how XXXX performs with this track:
- 

The next track is [Playing God by Polyphia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5NoQg8LdDk). I focus on the tonal quality and the level of energy conveyed by the guitars. This track also helps assess the balance of the bass against the midrange, which is reflected by the relative loudness between the bass guitar and the rest of the music. Here are key observations about how XXXX performs with this track:
- 

The next track on our list is the aria of [Bach's Goldberg Variations, recorded by Lang Lang](https://youtu.be/linQUK6jNmg?si=v_2nz6exiNXsZUjU). I find that piano is the best instrument to assess the overall tonal balance of an IEM. Simply put, if the piano does not sound even across the frequencies, the midrange of an IEM is imbalanced. Here are key observations about how XXXX performs with this track:
- 

The next track on our list is [Ciaccona from Bach's Violin Partita No.2 in D Minor, performed by Kavakos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtA5DbswJ90). This track aims to assess two aspects: the rendition of violin and the reproduction of upper treble energy, which is reflected by the quality and detail of the reverberation and micro details at the decay end of violin notes. Here are key observations about how XXXX performs with this track:
- 

The final track on our timbre test is [Synchro BOM-BA-YE by Tokyo Kosei Wind Orchestra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lwPiXnOGZ4). This track aims to test the tonal balance and timbre of the upper midrange and treble region. There are two cues I focus on in this track: the hand claps at the beginning, and the tonal quality of all brass instruments throughout the track. Here are key observations about how XXXX performs with this track:

**Bass and perceived dynamic:**

Overview of the bass and dynamic using the soundwheel terminology:
- Attack
- Bass precision
- Punch
- Powerful

Let's examine the bass and perceived dynamics of XXXX with some test tracks. The first one is [A Reckoning in Blood from The Ghost of Tsushima OST](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaBMXXo-vdU). I'll focus on the crescendo at 01:10, which an ideal dynamic IEM should effectively communicate. Additionally, the beats from 02:50 need to be strong, snappy, and precise, requiring excellent control across the entire frequency range. Here are key observations about how XXXX performs with this track:
- 

The next track is [Strength of a Thousand Men (Live) by Two Steps from Hell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POmTXTBtRZA). I'll pay attention to the quality bass accompanying each beat. An IEM with perfect bass handling should convey a sense of "grippiness" and texture in the bass region, making the bass line growl rather than low-pitched hum. Lastly, every beat must be snappy and incisive to capture the marching energy of this track. Here are key observations about how XXXX performs with this track:
- 

**Resolution:** *To me, "resolution" can be broken down into three components: (1) Sharpness, incisiveness, or "definition" of note attacks (see the figure above). (2) The separation of instruments and vocals, especially when they overlap on the soundstage. (3) The texture and details in the decay side of the notes. The first two give music clarity and make it easy to track individual elements of a mix. The last provides music details and nuances.*

Describe the resolution using the terminology from soundwheel:
- Clean
- Presence
- Clarity
- Detailed
- Natural

Let's elaborate on the resolution of XXXX with some test tracks. For the first track, we again listen to [Ciaccona from Bach's Violin Partita No. 2 in D Minor, performed by Kavakos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtA5DbswJ90). I focus on the micro details such as the bow catching the strings. I also focus on the quality and nuances of the reverberation and decays of the notes. Here are key observations about how XXXX performs with this track and how it compares against other reference IEMs:
- 

The next track is the "controlled chaos" [ABC feat. Sophia Black by Polyphia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mtd24QIBJ5Y). With this track, I focus on an IEM's ability to not crumble under the complexity of overlapping layers in the mix. An IEM with ideal resolution would make it easy for me to hear everything, down to the very faint overdub by Sophia Black on the side channels right from the opening of the track. Here are key observations about how XXXX performs with this track and how it compares against other reference IEMs:
- 

**Stereo imaging and soundstage:** *Stereo imaging or "soundstage" is a psychoacoustic illusion that different recording elements appear at various locations inside and around your head. Your brain creates based on the cues in the recording, which are enhanced or diminushed by your IEMs, your DAC, and your amplifier. In rare cases, with some specific songs, some IEMs can trick you into thinking that the sound comes from the environment (a.k.a., "holographic")*

![](/assets/images/soundstage.png)

Overview of the soundstage and imaging capability using the soundwheel terminology.:
- Spatial extent: depth, width, envelopment
- Localiation: distance, internality, localisability
- Reverberation

Let's listen to some test tracks to assess the soundstage and imaging capability of XXXX. The first one is [Original Sound Effect Track - Memory from Gundam Seed Destiny OST album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhJWAWqExQs). This track compiles all sound effects used in the show, arranged atmospherically and immersively. An IEM with ideal soundstage and imaging should effectively utilize this information to create a diverse soundstage, with sound elements appearing in all three dimensions, offering contrast between near and distant sounds. Many elements on the left and right channels will seem to originate outside the ears. Here are key observations about how XXXX performs with this track and how it compares against other reference IEMs:
- 

The next track is [Shadow of Baar Dau](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXcLuLQ_5oM). This one tests an IEM's ability to convincingly convey the sense of distance of background elements, such as the string section at 00:20 on the front left and the vocal chants on the front right at 00:40. An IEM with perfect soundstage and imaging should make this track feel spacious, creating an illusion that some background elements originate outside the head. In essence, it should provide a fully immersive listening experience. Here are key observations about how XXXX performs with this track and how it compares against other reference IEMs:
