Howdy, folks! I have been using the desktop DAC + amp combo from HiBy, the FD5, for over 4 months now, and I think this device has been flying under the radar of most audiophiles. Let's talk about it and how it fits within my setup and preference, which revolves around sensitive IEMs rather than power-hungry planar headphones. 

Preambles
===
- In this review, I use the term "source" to denote a DAC+amp combo for brevity and convenience. 
- Sources do not make sounds. Therefore, when I say sources "sound" a certain way, I talk about the change they make to my IEMs and earphones. 
- I want my music to be crisp, clear, well-separated and form a 3D soundstage around my head. Sources that intensify those characteristics of my IEMs are considered "better". 
- The unit used for this review was a sample provided by HiBy (Thank you!). The unit is retailed for $429 and can be found on [HiBy web store (non-affiliated link)](https://store.hiby.com/products/hiby-fd5).

General Information 
===

HiBy FD5 is a **desktop-class DAC+amp combo** device, however its inputs and outputs are more in-line with portable gears than desktop gears. FD5 receives digital signal from your phone or computer via a **USB-C cable or bluetooth**, converts that digital signal into analogue signal using an array of **4xAKM4493 DAC chips** (operating in current mode), amplifies the analogue signal using **a built-in amplifier that can operate in either class A or AB**, and finally sends it to your listening devices via a **3.5mm single-ended output or 4.4mm balanced output**. You can also bypass the amplifier of FD5 and uses the analogue signal from its DAC directly via the line outputs at the back of the device, available in both 3.5mm single-ended and 4.4mm balanced variants. Keen readers would notice some interesting differences in the input and output options of FD5. Firstly, familiar input options for desktop DACs such as coax and optical input are not included here. (Luckily, the ancient USB-B connector is also absent). Secondly, FD5 includes balanced line output, which is quite rare for a device at this price point. Thirdly, the line out connections are 3.5mm and 4.4mm rather than the RCA and XLR commonly used in other DACs. And finally, FD5 can act as a bluetooth receiver. 

In other words, FD5 feels like a gigantic USB dongle DAC rather than the usual desktop "stacks" like Schiit Modi+Magni or Topping D90+A90.

Let's take a closer look at FD5. My first impression with this device was how *dense* it feels: it's quite small but heavy. The shell of FD5 is constructed entirely from a thick aluminium alloy, save for the top panel which is constructed from thick glass. The device itself actually a stack consisting of two separated components connected via a 20-pin connector and strong magnets. The bottom layer contains the power supply circuitry, while the top layer contains the DAC, amplifier, USB and bluetooth controllers, and the display screen. 

Actually, there is a third component that is usually hidden under the desk: the AC adapter that converts 240V AC from the wall plug to the 12V DC required by the power supply circuitry of FD5. And boy oh boy did HiBy supplied FD5 with a beefy adapter. This brick can output upto 60W DC (12V at 5A), even though FD5 itself only requires at most 24W. To be honest, I am a bit disappointed that FD5 still requires an external power brick, given the fact that is already contains one layer designed especially for handling power supply. Another point that HiBy could improve here is adopting USB-C power supply rather than requiring the old-school barrel plug. Had FD5 been equipped with USB-C power supply, it would have been able to be used as a transportable device, meaning I can bring this brick with me on travel and power it directly from my powerbank or my tiny 100W GnA charger. As it stands, the clunky plastic brick stands in stark contrast against the high-tech, futuristic vibe of FD5. 

Speaking of design, I think this is one area where HiBy shines again with FD5. This device continues the retro-futuristic, cyberpunk vibe that HiBy started with R4. I particularly enjoy the design of the top plate of FD5 with the layered design elements of glasses and brushed metal, the light up "5" logo, and the OLED screen. Of course, whether a design "vibe" with you is totally subjective, and I get it if you find the design of FD5 tacky or inauthentic (e.g., they show part of the circuitry under the glass panel rather than a decorative element that pretends to be a heatsink). However, similarly to the case with R4, I appreciate the extra mile that they went with this device, when they could have gotten away with just another non-descriptive metal box and call it a day. 

Before we move on, let's take a tour around the device. From the top, you will find the decorative glass panel with a "Fn" button, a tiny OLED screen showing the operating mode of the device, and a digital tactile volume wheel. You can turn on and off the device with a long press on Fn button. A single press allows you to switch between USB and bluetooth mode. Double click when you are in Bluetooth mode allows you to enter pairing mode.

On the front of the device, you would find 3.5mm and 4.4mm headphone outputs on the top layer and a LED indicator on the bottom layer. This LED lights up when the bottom layer receives electricity. 

On the left hand side of the device, you would find two switches. The first one allows you to switch the amplifier between class A and class AB operating mode. The second switch allows you to change the gain from low to high. There is nothing on the right side of the device. 

At the back of the device, you would find the 3.5mm and 4.4mm line output on the upper layer, next to the USB-C data input. On the bottom layer, you would find the 12V DC input and a power switch. 


Functionality 
===

In the last four months, this device has been connected to my desktop computer at home via a USB hub hidden under desk. I used it with both IEMs and speakers. My Creative Pebble active speakers are connected to FD5 via an aux cable connected to the 3.5mm line out at the back of the device, whilst my IEMs are connected to the 4.4mm headphone out at the front. When both outputs are connected, FD5 would only play music from the headphones output. Therefore, when I want to listen to my speakers, I simply disconnect my IEMs. I used this simple setup for music, movies, video editing, as well as gaming. I also use FD5 to output sine sweeps signals to measure IEMs. It performs well without any unexpected quirks or hiccups. Just for the record, I use Linux on my desktop (Arch, btw), which could lead to nasty compatibility issues. Yet, FD5 pairs with my computer immediately out of the box with zero problem. It's hard to say whether HiBy software engineering team, the Linux kernel developers, or Pipewire developers deserve the credit for this seamless compatibility, but I'm glad that it works.

There are two aspects of FD5's functionality in USB mode that HiBy does an outstanding job and deserves more highlight, in my opinion. The first one is the volume control. HiBy makes a very sensible choice of not ramping up the gain level too quickly, meaning I have a wide range of volume adjustment even when I pair FD5 with highly sensitive IEMs. In other words, I never have the fear that if I touch the volume wheel incorrectly, I will blow my ears out like some smaller USB dongles.

The second highlight of FD5 is that it does not make random loud "POP" when the music stream stops, such as the moment between songs. It is the case with both headphone outputs and line outputs, from both single-ended and balanced connectors. You might think that it is such a minute thing. However, with sensitive IEMs, the pops can get quite loud and unsettling. 

Before we move on, let's briefly talk about the Bluetooth receiver function of FD5. I have to admit that I couldn't find any practical use case for it myself. However, I'm happy to report that the latency is kept to a minimum, meaning it is possible to watch videos and play casual games. Other use cases that are sensitive to audio latency are still best served with a wired connection.

*Note: Comparisons in this section were based on A/B tests where participating devices were volume-matched to 73dB with a coupler using pink noise. Unless mentioned otherwise, AFUL Cantor was used as the IEM in the comparisons.*
