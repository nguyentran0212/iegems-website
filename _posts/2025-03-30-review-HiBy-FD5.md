Howdy, folks! I have been using the desktop DAC + amp combo from HiBy, the FD5, for over 4 months now, and I think this device has been flying under the radar of most audiophiles. Let's talk about it and how it fits within my setup and preference, which revolves around sensitive IEMs rather than power-hungry planar headphones. 

Preambles
===
- In this review, I use the term "source" to denote a DAC+amp combo for brevity and convenience. 
- Sources do not make sounds. Therefore, when I say sources "sound" a certain way, I talk about the change they make to my IEMs and earphones. 
- I want my music to be crisp, clear, well-separated and form a 3D soundstage around my head. Sources that intensify those characteristics of my IEMs are considered "better". 
- The unit used for this review was a sample provided by HiBy (Thank you!). The unit is retailed for $429 and can be found on [HiBy web store (non-affiliated link)](https://store.hiby.com/products/hiby-fd5).
