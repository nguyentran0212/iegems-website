Another day, another addition to the increasingly bewildering HiBy DAP lineup. This time, it’s a “micro” player called the R3 Pro 2. And before you ask—yes, I know there was an R3II recently. No, this isn’t the same. This is the R3 **Pro** 2. Definitely don’t confuse it with the R3II **2025**, which is just a refresh of the R3II. The R3 Pro 2, on the other hand, is a proper upgrade to the R3II. Why it’s not called the R3III? Your guess is as good as mine. Maybe ask HiBy.  

Anyway, let’s stop banging on about names and get to the actual player. Spoiler: it makes more sense than the product line or naming scheme. Roll the intro.

Preambles
===
- In this review, I use the term "source" to denote a DAC+amp combo for brevity and convenience. 
- Sources do not make sounds. Therefore, when I say sources "sound" a certain way, I talk about the change they make to my IEMs and earphones. 
- I want my music to be crisp, clear, well-separated and form a 3D soundstage around my head. Sources that intensify those characteristics of my IEMs are considered "better". 
- The unit used for this review was a sample provided by HiBy (Thank you!). The unit is retailed for $199 and can be found on [HiBy web store (non-affiliated link)](https://store.hiby.com/products/hiby-r3pro-ii).

General Information 
===

The R3 Pro 2 is a **micro DAP**. As the label suggests, it’s significantly smaller than your average Android-based DAP. This thing is closer in spirit to the MP3 players of yesteryear: pocketable, unobtrusive, and frankly, a bit of a novelty in a world of 6.8-inch screens. It packs a 3.3-inch touchscreen. Not much to look at, but it’s there. You’ll use it. You’ll curse it. You’ll eventually grow fond of it.

The R3 Pro 2 runs **HiBy OS — a custom Linux-based system**. HiBy writes the whole shebang themselves: the audio stack, the UI logic, the DSP tricks (and the bugs. Don't forget the bugs). They’ve done this before (By "this", of course I mean the software, not the bugs). In fact, if you pick up a random non-Android DAP from China, it's likely to run a version of HiBy OS. But this time, we have a new OS version that feels a bit different: less familiar, more streamlined, and frankly, a bit less… clunky than the old one on the R3II. The software experience is powered by the new X1600E System-on-Chip (SoC), which promised not only better processing prowess but also better Bluetooth connectivity. We’ll get into how the software *feels* later. 

Now, the audio circuitry. You want the familiar? Here it is. **Dual CS43198 DACs**, those same chips that’ve been showing up in almost every USB DAC you’ve seen in the last few years. On the amp side, we have **four OPA1622 opamps**. Yes, the same four that power the R6 Pro Max, HiBy’s current sub-flagship DAP. So you’re getting a serious chunk of that DAP’s DNA in a device that’s about a fraction the size (and the price). And, of course, like almost every other "audiophile-class" DAP and DAC, you have two independent clocks. Output-wise, there is no surprise: 3.5mm single-ended and 4.4mm balanced. The USB-C port also support digital data output in case you want to use R3 Pro 2 to drive another DAC. 

Before we go any further, let’s take a proper look at the physical design—because, frankly, this thing is a paradox.

First: despite being micro in size, **the R3 Pro 2 is thick**. Not just “a bit chunky”—no, this is a proper *thicc* DAP. Nearly as fat as the iBasso DX300, and roughly 80% the thickness of the already-legendary HiBy R6 Pro Max. I genuinely laughed the first time I pulled it from the box. It looked like a DAP that had been fed too much protein and was now judging your life choices. The frame? Anodised aluminium. Smooth and cool. You’ve got a few colour options to choose from. I went for the orange. It’s not subtle. It’s not understated. In fact, it’s *loud*. And I love it. 

Now, let's look closely. The top edge, plus a few grooves near the top and around the back? That’s plastic. Not a flaw—just where HiBy hides the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth antennas. Left side: volume buttons (snappy, satisfying), a microSD slot behind a squishy rubber seal, and a tiny lanyard hole. Right side: power button and playback controls nestled in a nicely machined groove, with the word “PRO” carved into the metal like some sorts of badge of honor. Bottom: USB-C flanked by the 3.5mm and 4.4mm sockets. The USB-C connector handles data, charging, and output.

And then there’s the back with the striking *Ultrasuede* felt plate in the same colour with the metal frame. It’s the signature look HiBy lifted from the R8II, but dialled down for a smaller form factor. The fabric Hiby used is from Toray, not Alcantara like on the R8II. But, you know, tomato, to-mah-toh, since you still have the same softness, the same “I want to pet this” energy. It’s inviting. It’s tactile. It’s *nice*.

Now, the obvious question: durability. You would be right to concern because high-tech fabric or not, at the end of the day, it's still your greasy hands against a piece of fuzzy fabric. That said, after weeks of use with no case, no gloves, no ritualistic hand-washing, I’ve seen no wear, no fraying, no discoloration. Even when I accidentally spilled a bit of cleaning spray on it, there were no stains nor blemishes. If you’re nervous about the durability, HiBy’s kind enough to include a plastic case in the box. Or, for the slightly more indulgent, you can buy a proper leather one from them. But honestly? The felt back is one of the best things about this DAP. It makes it feel like something you’d actually *want* to hold. Therefore, I'm going to live dangerously and use the DAP bare.


Experience
===

So, how does it *feel* to use this DAP? Well, I’ve been daily driving this DAP for many weeks before writing this review (probably many more weeks than HiBy ever expected). It’s not just a review unit; it’s now a cohabitant. A tiny, thicc cohabitant that insists on being in my pocket, my bag, and occasionally my dreams.

**Functionality**: Let’s get practical. What *can* you actually *do* with this thing? It’s not just a music player. It’s a Swiss Army knife of audio. Here’s the full spread:

- Play your local library from a microSD card. Done. No fuss.  
- Stream Tidal or Qobuz *directly*—yes, the DAP is its own client. No phone, no laptop. It’s… functional. The UI is barebones, but it works. You can browse new releases, check playlists, and listen to your own library on the streaming services. I didn’t test Qobuz, but Tidal worked well enough.  
- DLNA streaming from your local media server? Theoretically possible. I didn’t test it—my server wasn’t set up. But the option’s there.  
- AirPlay? It *connects*. That’s all I’ll say. It works. But honestly, it’s easier to just pair your phone via Bluetooth.  
- Bluetooth: use it as a wireless DAC/amp for your phone or laptop. Alternatively, you can connect your earbuds to R3 Pro 2 and listen to the audio coming out from the DAP.  
- USB-C: plug it into your laptop or PC and it becomes a USB DAC. Or, you can have it digital audio to a separate DAC, essentially turning R3 Pro 2 into a digital transport.  

And yes, you can read books on it. I don’t know why. A 3.3-inch screen? For a novel? It's like trying to read War and Peace on a postage stamp. You’ll finish it, but you’ll question your life choices.

For most of my testing, I used it as a USB DAC for my Linux workstation during the work hours and play local files while commuting. You can choose to charge it while it’s plugged in. I didn’t. Why? Superstition: I didn’t want to overcharge the battery. The sound in USB DAC indistinguishable from the local audio playback. **But here’s the rub: latency in USB DAC mode.** It’s noticeable. Not terrible, but enough to make you twitch if you’re syncing audio with video. And yes, *all* DAPs I’ve tested so far, Android or Linux, have this same problem. It’s not unique. It’s disappointing that it's still there on the R3 Pro 2. 

Now, the surprise: **the (lack of) Bluetooth latency**. This is where the R3 Pro 2 *shines*. I don’t know if it’s the X1600E, or the bluetooth implementation of HiBy, but it’s the *first* DAP in my collection that makes casual YouTube and movie watching *tolerable* over Bluetooth. It’s not perfect. But it’s *tolerable*. For the first time, I can say: “Yes, I can use this DAP for watching videos without wanting to scream.” That’s a win. If HiBy ever fixes the USB DAC latency, this thing would be a one-stop shop for every use cases requiring an audio source in your audio setup. 

**Battery:** Before we dive into the software, let’s talk battery. HiBy stuffed it with a 4000mAh cell that is supposed to be good enough for 21+ hours of playback and 900 hours of standby. Now, 900 hours standby? That’s only possible if you turn the thing off. But the rest? *Accurate*. With my usage that includes all-day USB DAC mode, about an hour of offline playback, an hour of Bluetooth streaming, I’m getting at least *four days* of real-world use before needing a top-up. In fact, I charged so rarely that I can barely recall the last time I charge this device during my weeks of testing. When it's time to charge, R3 Pro 2 is blazingly fast thanks to the PD2.0 fast charging. I generally just plug this device to my 100W laptop charger and go deal with other house chores and come back to a fully charged device, ready for another week.

**Software features:** Offline playback works—just not beautifully. Tap the "Music" button on the main menu, and you’re handed a six-option interface: *All*, *Files*, *Albums*, *Artists*, *Genres*, and *Album Artist*. The last one’s a long-sought-after feature in earlier versions, given by the number of questions I received after publishing reviews of DAPs based on the older HiBy OS.    

At the top-right corner of that page sits a gear icon—your gateway to playback and DSP settings. It’s all mixed together here: gapless playback, repeat modes, folder-based playthroughs, plus HiBy’s signature MSEB EQ, a 10-band graphical EQ, and stereo expander plugin. DAC controls are also present—selectable low-pass filters, oversampling (OS) vs non-oversampling (NOS), and DSD handling options.

Feature-wise, it’s not bad. However, the interface could use better grouping. You’ll want to turn on *gapless playback* and *automatically slide to the playback interface* for smoother transitions; those two make a noticeable difference in real-world use.  

There are occasional hiccups in daily uses. For example, album art might fail to load, or the song list won’t update when you skip tracks. These small glitches were mostly resolve after the first firmware update. Still, one nagging issue remains: no progressive JPEG support. Same SD card? On an Android DAP, your album art is full and crisp. On the R3 Pro 2, they are often missing, which is a shame as the album arts that actually show up looks quite lovely on the 3.3 inch screen.

On the plus side, R3 Pro 2 handles multi-CD albums far better than HiBy’s own mobile app does—so yes, you win some, lose some. 

**Sound tweaking options:** Yes, it’s a HiBy DAP—so you’re going to find plenty of tools to shape the sound. Here’s what’s on offer:  

- **MSEB**: A parametric EQ with pre-set filters that lets you adjust the overall tonal character without needing to know exactly which frequencies drive certain feelings. You can dial in a range of effects—like shifting from cold and bright to warm and dark, adjusting bass depth (light or deep), changing mid-bass texture (fast or thumpy), tweaking note clarity (crisp or thick), placing vocals either recessed or forward, shaping female vocal overtones ("detox" or vivid), softening or sharpening sibilance across the spectrum, and controlling how much air and body you get in the upper treble (slow and musical vs fast and hard). It’s not precise engineering—it’s more about mood. And it works.  

- **10-band graphical EQ**: Runs from 31Hz to 16kHz. Standard stuff. Gives you fine control where you need it, but doesn’t go deep into psychoacoustic territory.  

- **Soundfield**: A simple stereo extender that widens the stereo image by pushing left and right channels further apart. It makes the soundstage feel artificially wider, but it’s not anything the speakervirtualisation plugin available on HiBy’s Android DAPs.   

- **Gain**: Two options—low or high. I did not hear much, if any, sonic difference this time, so I leave the DAP at low gain.

- **NOS (non-oversampling)**: A toggle between oversampling and non-oversampling modes. NOS is technically less ideal from a signal fidelity standpoint—it’s not the cleanest reconstruction—but some listeners find it more “relaxed” or “musical”. I find that NOS works better with hi-res files.  

Now, here’s the reality: deeper DSP tools, like dynamic extenders and convolutional filters, are missing. This is likely due to the limitation of the processor on R3 Pro 2. And because the R3 Pro 2 uses off-the-shelf CS DACs instead of HiBy’s custom DARWIN circuits, fine-grained control over DAC performance isn’t available either.
