Another day, another addition to the increasingly bewildering HiBy DAP lineup. This time, it’s a “micro” player called the R3 Pro 2. And before you ask—yes, I know there was an R3II recently. No, this isn’t the same. This is the R3 **Pro** 2. Definitely don’t confuse it with the R3II **2025**, which is just a refresh of the R3II. The R3 Pro 2, on the other hand, is a proper upgrade to the R3II. Why it’s not called the R3III? Your guess is as good as mine. Maybe ask HiBy.  

Anyway, let’s stop banging on about names and get to the actual player. Spoiler: it makes more sense than the product line or naming scheme. Roll the intro.

Preambles
===
- In this review, I use the term "source" to denote a DAC+amp combo for brevity and convenience. 
- Sources do not make sounds. Therefore, when I say sources "sound" a certain way, I talk about the change they make to my IEMs and earphones. 
- I want my music to be crisp, clear, well-separated and form a 3D soundstage around my head. Sources that intensify those characteristics of my IEMs are considered "better". 
- The unit used for this review was a sample provided by HiBy (Thank you!). The unit is retailed for $999 and can be found on [HiBy web store (non-affiliated link)](https://store.hiby.com/products/hiby-r6-pro-max).

General Information 
===

R3 Pro 2 is a micro DAP. as the categorization suggests, it’s way smaller than your usual Android-based DAPs that are as large as phones and way thicker. In fact, R3 Pro 2 is more similar to the MP3 players of the old days.  The screen is only 3.3 inch, with touch support.
    
The software side of R3 Pro 2 is also quite simpler vs Android-based DAP. It runs a custom operating system (OS) called HiBy OS, which is based on a Linux kernel. HiBy essentially writes their own audio suites and the front-end logic themselves. Of course, this is not their first forray into custom OS. Quite a few DAPs on the market run on HiBy OS. What’s new with R3 Pro 2 is that we are seeing a new version of HiBy OS, which is quite a bit different from the old and familiar one on R3II. This new version of software is enabled thanks to the new system-on-chip (SoC) X1600E. We will talk about the software and performance later in this review.
    
Let’s talk about audio circuitry. The DAC side is powered by the familiar typology: Dual CS 43198 that is so popular in the last few years amongst USB DAC devices. The amplifier side is powered by 4xOPA1622 opamps. Sounds familiar? Yes, the same four opamps used in HiBy’s highend R6 Pro Max DAP that I reviewed a few months ago. As expected, there are two independent audio clocks to reduce jitter.
    
The amplifier circuitry outputs to two sockets: 3.5mm single-ended and 4.4mm balanced output. Again, they are exactly what you would expect from a niche, audiophile-class DAP.

The R3 Pro 2 is a micro‑DAP that has the bulk of a relic MP3 player rather than a smartphone‑sized Android box. Its 3.3‑inch capacitive display keeps you from having to squint at an absurdly small screen, but it’s still tiny enough that you could slide it into a pocket without any feeling of regret.  

Under the hood it runs HiBy OS – a stripped‑down Linux kernel with the audio stack and UI written by HiBy themselves. This isn’t their first foray into custom OS, but the version on R3 Pro 2 is noticeably different from the one that powered the R3II; the change is made possible by the new X1600E SoC. We’ll dig into what that means for performance later.

The circuitry stays in well‑trodden territory: dual CS 43198 DACs, the same popular pair seen on USB gear over the last few years. The amplifying stage uses four OPA1622 op‑amps – exactly those that sit behind HiBy’s high‑end R6 Pro Max. Two independent clocks run the boards in an attempt to keep jitter at a minimum.

Finally, the output options are no surprise: a 3.5 mm single‑ended jack and a 4.4 mm balanced port, as expected from a niche audiophile unit.
