Another day, another addition to the increasingly bewildering HiBy DAP lineup. This time, it’s a “micro” player called the R3 Pro 2. And before you ask—yes, I know there was an R3II recently. No, this isn’t the same. This is the R3 **Pro** 2. Definitely don’t confuse it with the R3II **2025**, which is just a refresh of the R3II. The R3 Pro 2, on the other hand, is a proper upgrade to the R3II. Why it’s not called the R3III? Your guess is as good as mine. Maybe ask HiBy.  

Anyway, let’s stop banging on about names and get to the actual player. Spoiler: it makes more sense than the product line or naming scheme. Roll the intro.

Preambles
===
- In this review, I use the term "source" to denote a DAC+amp combo for brevity and convenience. 
- Sources do not make sounds. Therefore, when I say sources "sound" a certain way, I talk about the change they make to my IEMs and earphones. 
- I want my music to be crisp, clear, well-separated and form a 3D soundstage around my head. Sources that intensify those characteristics of my IEMs are considered "better". 
- The unit used for this review was a sample provided by HiBy (Thank you!). The unit is retailed for $999 and can be found on [HiBy web store (non-affiliated link)](https://store.hiby.com/products/hiby-r6-pro-max).

General Information 
===

The R3 Pro 2 is a micro DAP. As the label suggests, it’s significantly smaller than your average Android-based DAP. This thing is closer in spirit to the MP3 players of yesteryear: pocketable, unobtrusive, and frankly, a bit of a novelty in a world of 6.8-inch screens. It packs a 3.3-inch touchscreen. Not much to look at, but it’s there. You’ll use it. You’ll curse it. You’ll eventually grow fond of it.

The R3 Pro 2 runs HiBy OS — a custom Linux-based system. HiBy writes the whole shebang themselves: the audio stack, the UI logic, the DSP tricks (and the bugs. Don't forget the bugs). They’ve done this before (By "this", of course I mean the software, not the bugs). In fact, if you pick up a random non-Android DAP from China, it's likely to run a version of HiBy OS. But this time, we have a new OS version that feels a bit different: less familiar, more streamlined, and frankly, a bit less… clunky than the old one on the R3II. The software experience is powered by the new X1600E System-on-Chip (SoC), which promised not only better processing prowess but also better Bluetooth connectivity. We’ll get into how the software *feels* later. 

Now, the audio circuitry. You want the familiar? Here it is. Dual CS43198 DACs, those same chips that’ve been showing up in almost every USB DAC you’ve seen in the last few years. On the amp side, we have four OPA1622 opamps. Yes, the same four that power the R6 Pro Max, HiBy’s current sub-flagship DAP. So you’re getting a serious chunk of that DAP’s DNA in a device that’s about a fraction the size (and the price). And, of course, like almost every other "audiophile-class" DAP and DAC, you have two independent clocks. Output-wise, there is no surprise: 3.5mm single-ended and 4.4mm balanced. 

Before we go any further, let’s take a proper look at the physical design—because, frankly, this thing is a paradox.

First: despite being micro in size, the R3 Pro 2 is thick. Not just “a bit chunky”—no, this is a proper *thicc* DAP. Nearly as fat as the iBasso DX300, and roughly 80% the thickness of the already-legendary HiBy R6 Pro Max. I genuinely laughed the first time I pulled it from the box. It looked like someone had taken a high-end DAP and squeezed it into a smaller shell—without letting go of the bulk.  It looked like a DAP that had been fed too much protein and was now judging your life choices. The frame? Anodised aluminium. Smooth, cool, and—let’s be honest—very much *not* plastic. You’ve got a few colour options. I went for the orange. It’s not subtle. It’s not understated. It’s *loud*. And I love it. 

Now, look closely. The top edge, plus a few grooves near the top and around the back? That’s plastic. Not a flaw—just where HiBy hides the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth antennas. Left side: volume buttons (snappy, satisfying), a microSD slot (no surprises), and a tiny lanyard hole. Right side: power button, and playback controls nestled in a nicely machined groove, with the word “PRO” carved into the metal like some sorts of badge of honor. Bottom: USB-C flanked by the 3.5mm and 4.4mm sockets. The USB-C connector handles data, charging, and output.

And then there’s the back. The *Ultrasuede* felt plate. Toray’s version, not Alcantara—but you know, tomato, to-mah-toh. Same softness. Same “I want to pet this” energy. It’s the signature look HiBy lifted from the R8II, but dialled down for a smaller form factor. I’m not going to lie: it feels like a warm hug in your hand. It’s inviting. It’s tactile. It’s *nice*.

Now, the obvious question: durability? It’s synthetic suede. It’s not bulletproof. But after weeks of use—no case, no gloves, no ritualistic hand-washing—I’ve seen no wear, no fraying, no discoloration. Even when I accidentally spilled a bit of cleaning spray on it? No stains. No blemishes. If you’re nervous about the durability, HiBy’s kind enough to include a plastic case in the box. Or, for the slightly more indulgent, you can buy a proper leather one from them. But honestly? The felt back is one of the best things about this DAP. It makes it feel like something you’d actually *want* to hold.
