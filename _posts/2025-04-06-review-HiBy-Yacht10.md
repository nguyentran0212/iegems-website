Howdy folks! I have been using new single-dynamic-driver IEM from HiBy, the Yacht10, for a few months. Let's talk about it.

Forewords
===

- What I look for in an IEM is **immersion.** I want to feel the orchestra around my head, track individual instruments, and hear all of their textures and details. I'm not picky about tonality, as long as it does not make the orchestra, violin, cellos, and pianos sound wrong.
- I rate IEMs within with a consistent scale from **1 (Poor) to 3 (Good) to 5 (Outstanding)**. An overall ranking of 3/5 or above is considered positive. 
- Ranking list and measurement database are onÂ [my IEM review blog](https://iegems.nk-tran.com/).
- The terminology for subjective impressions in this review is based on the Audio Wheel for reproduced sound defined in the technical report [ITU-R BS.2399-0](https://www.itu.int/pub/R-REP-BS.2399)
- **This review is based on a review sample from HiBy (Thank you!).** I have no affiliation with or financial interest in HiBy.
- The unit retails for US$129 at the time this review was published. Unaffiliated link: [HiBy Web Store](https://store.hiby.com/products/hiby-yacht-10)

General Information
===

Yacht10 is the first release within the "Yacht" IEM series from HiBy. One of the main themes of this series "discovery": enabling you, the listener, to explore the *variety* in tonal characteristics of different types of drivers (a.k.a., speakers) and find the match between the unique "voices" of the earphones and the expression of your music. If you have been knee-deep in the "meta" of IEM hobby, you might notice an interesting deviation here: instead of trying to reach a homogeneous, "Internet-experts-approved" sound signature, HiBy embraces the unique characteristics of driver types and the diversity that they bring to the "voicing" of IEMs. As you would see, there are pros and cons at play here. But we are getting ahead of ourselves. 

As the name implies, Yacht10 is powered by a single 10mm dynamic driver, which was designed in-house with the aim of achieving low distortion. These drivers use a hybrid diaphram that combines a Magnesium-Aluminium alloy dome (lightweight and rigid) with a flexible polymer-based suspension. The hybrid diaphragm is connected to lightweight voice coil suspended between two magnetic cores which provides a strong magnetic flux density of 1.2 tesla. The results from Hiby's audio analyzer unit shows a low THD+N at less than 0.4% across 20Hz-20kHz frequency range, reaching down to 0.045% at 500Hz and just 0.098% at 1kHz.1. 

Of course, the drivers themselves are just a part of the equation when designing the a single-dynamic-driver IEM. The other parts include the chambers at the front and the back of the drivers themselves and the air vents. Together, these structures control the behaviour of the drivers, such as how much dampening is applied. Yacht10 includes a metal rear chamber, which is connected to a rather large vent position right on the faceplate of the IEM. The other vent (front vent) is position next to the nozzle, as expected.

The entire earpiece of Yacht10 is machined from the T6063 aluminium alloy. Each earpiece is made up of two metal parts, snap-fitted together. You can see a seamline on the side of the earpieces where the parts are joined. 

The nozzles of Yacht10 are molded into the earpieces. They have protruding lips at the top to prevent eartips from slipping off. The nozzle measures at 5.3mm at the narrowest point and 6.0mm at the widest point at the lips. The nozzle length is 5.1mm, meaning it can fit most eartips. The total protrusion from the base of the earpieces to the tip of the nozzles measure at 10mm.

Non-sound Aspects
===

Yacht10 comes in an attractive box that carries the same "cyberpunk" design of recent HiBy releases, the R4 and FD5. Inside the box, you would find a familiar set of accessories:

- Earpieces themselves.
- A plastic box containing 3 sets of silicone ear tips and 3 sets of foam ear tips.
- A 2-wire cable that terminates with HiBy's interchangeable plug system. 
- 3.5mm and 4.4mm adapter to use with the interchangeable plug system.
- A nice faux leather storage case.
- A small cleaning brush.
- Paperwork.

You can choose some additional accessories when buying Yacht10 from HiBy webstore:

- [WG01](https://store.hiby.com/products/hiby-wg01-silicone-eartips) "Wave Guided Liquid Silicone Eartips" ($10 as a bundle, $19 separate): these after-market eartips remind me of the famous Xelastec eartips. However, Hiby's version is less sticky, thus easier to use and maintain. These ear tips have wide opening and longer stem, making them suitable for IEMs with nozzles on the shorter side such as most HiBy's IEMs. Personally, I found that WG01 is a must as I couldn't get a reliable seal with both the stock silicone and foam tips.
- [HC1 plug](https://store.hiby.com/products/hiby-hc1-plug-for-cu4-and-cu4-cable) ($20 as a bundle, $24 separate): this "plug" is actually a tiny USB-C dongle that can be attached seamlessly to the provided cable of Yacht10, allowing you to use this IEM with phones or tablet PC directly without bringing an additional dongle. Unfortunately, I'm not able discuss more about this device, as my sample seems to have a software problem. It does not make any sound on my HiBy R6 Pro Max, whilst it maxes out the volume and cannot be controlled on my iBasso DX300. 

In terms of fit and comfort, as I mentioned, I couldn't get a stable fit with either the stock silicone tips or the foam tips. This fit problem has been a common theme (for me) across some recent releases by HiBy such as Project ACE and Yvain. Luckily, the WG01 in medium works perfectly fine even in long listening session and when I walk around. 

Despite the big vents, I'm surprised to find that Yacht10 provides quite decent noise isolation, even in more noisy environments.
