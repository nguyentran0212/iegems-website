Howdy folks! I have been using new single-dynamic-driver IEM from HiBy, the Yacht10, for a few months. Let's talk about it.

Forewords
===

- What I look for in an IEM is **immersion.** I want to feel the orchestra around my head, track individual instruments, and hear all of their textures and details. I'm not picky about tonality, as long as it does not make the orchestra, violin, cellos, and pianos sound wrong.
- I rate IEMs within with a consistent scale from **1 (Poor) to 3 (Good) to 5 (Outstanding)**. An overall ranking of 3/5 or above is considered positive. 
- Ranking list and measurement database are onÂ [my IEM review blog](https://iegems.nk-tran.com/).
- The terminology for subjective impressions in this review is based on the Audio Wheel for reproduced sound defined in the technical report [ITU-R BS.2399-0](https://www.itu.int/pub/R-REP-BS.2399)
- **This review is based on a review sample from HiBy (Thank you!).** I have no affiliation with or financial interest in HiBy.
- The unit retails for US$129 at the time this review was published. Unaffiliated link: [HiBy Web Store](https://store.hiby.com/products/hiby-yacht-10)

General Information
===

![](/assets/images/HiBy-Yacht10/Yacht10_66.jpg)

Yacht10 is the first release within the "Yacht" IEM series from HiBy. One of the main themes of this series "discovery": enabling you, the listener, to explore the *variety* in tonal characteristics of different types of drivers (a.k.a., speakers) and find the match between the unique "voices" of the earphones and the expression of your music. If you have been knee-deep in the "meta" of IEM hobby, you might notice an interesting deviation here: instead of trying to reach a homogeneous, "Internet-experts-approved" sound signature, HiBy embraces the unique characteristics of driver types and the diversity that they bring to the "voicing" of IEMs. As you would see, there are pros and cons at play here. But we are getting ahead of ourselves. 

As the name implies, Yacht10 is powered by a single 10mm dynamic driver, which was designed in-house with the aim of achieving low distortion. These drivers use a hybrid diaphram that combines a Magnesium-Aluminium alloy dome (lightweight and rigid) with a flexible polymer-based suspension. The hybrid diaphragm is connected to lightweight voice coil suspended between two magnetic cores which provides a strong magnetic flux density of 1.2 tesla. The results from Hiby's audio analyzer unit shows a low THD+N at less than 0.4% across 20Hz-20kHz frequency range, reaching down to 0.045% at 500Hz and just 0.098% at 1kHz.1. 

Of course, the drivers themselves are just a part of the equation when designing the a single-dynamic-driver IEM. The other parts include the chambers at the front and the back of the drivers themselves and the air vents. Together, these structures control the behaviour of the drivers, such as how much dampening is applied. Yacht10 includes a metal rear chamber, which is connected to a rather large vent position right on the faceplate of the IEM. The other vent (front vent) is position next to the nozzle, as expected.

The entire earpiece of Yacht10 is machined from the T6063 aluminium alloy. Each earpiece is made up of two metal parts, snap-fitted together. You can see a seamline on the side of the earpieces where the parts are joined. 

The nozzles of Yacht10 are molded into the earpieces. They have protruding lips at the top to prevent eartips from slipping off. The nozzle measures at 5.3mm at the narrowest point and 6.0mm at the widest point at the lips. The nozzle length is 5.1mm, meaning it can fit most eartips. The total protrusion from the base of the earpieces to the tip of the nozzles measure at 10mm.

Yacht10 comes in an attractive box that carries the same "cyberpunk" design of recent HiBy releases, the R4 and FD5. Inside the box, you would find a familiar set of accessories:

- Earpieces themselves.
- A plastic box containing 3 sets of silicone ear tips and 3 sets of foam ear tips.
- A 2-wire cable that terminates with HiBy's interchangeable plug system. 
- 3.5mm and 4.4mm adapter to use with the interchangeable plug system.
- A nice faux leather storage case.
- A small cleaning brush.
- Paperwork.

You can choose some additional accessories when buying Yacht10 from HiBy webstore:

- [WG01](https://store.hiby.com/products/hiby-wg01-silicone-eartips) "Wave Guided Liquid Silicone Eartips" ($10 as a bundle, $19 separate): these after-market eartips remind me of the famous Xelastec eartips. However, Hiby's version is less sticky, thus easier to use and maintain. These ear tips have wide opening and longer stem, making them suitable for IEMs with nozzles on the shorter side such as most HiBy's IEMs. Personally, I found that WG01 is a must as I couldn't get a reliable seal with both the stock silicone and foam tips.
- [HC1 plug](https://store.hiby.com/products/hiby-hc1-plug-for-cu4-and-cu4-cable) ($20 as a bundle, $24 separate): this "plug" is actually a tiny USB-C dongle that can be attached seamlessly to the provided cable of Yacht10, allowing you to use this IEM with phones or tablet PC directly without bringing an additional dongle. Unfortunately, I'm not able discuss more about this device, as my sample seems to have a software problem. It does not make any sound on my HiBy R6 Pro Max, whilst it maxes out the volume and cannot be controlled on my iBasso DX300.

In terms of fit and comfort, as I mentioned, I couldn't get a stable fit with either the stock silicone tips or the foam tips. This fit problem has been a common theme (for me) across some recent releases by HiBy such as Project ACE and Yvain. Luckily, the WG01 in medium works perfectly fine even in long listening session and when I walk around. 

Despite the big vents, I'm surprised to find that Yacht10 provides quite decent noise isolation, even in more noisy environments.

**Timbre and tonality:** The tonality of Yacht10 was surprisingly delightful to me. It has just the right amount of energy in the lower midrange to gives most voices from deep bass voice of Johnny Cash to higher voice of Ed Sheeran and sense of richness. At the same time, it never overcooks this region and thus avoids any sense of muddiness or overtly colouring. Looking at the graph, we immediately see the reason of this excellent midrange: Yacht10 shares the same lower midrange tuning with one of my favourite and arguably the best midrange I have ever tested, the 7th Acoustic Supernova.

At the other end of the spectrum, HiBy has also done a good job with the upper midrange. Keen listeners might find the upper midrange ("ear gain") region tuned a bit old school in the sense that it has twin peaks at around 2.5kHz and 5kHz with a valley at 3-4kHz rather than peaking at 3kHz or maintaining a "flat top" between 2.5Khz and 5kHz, which are common approaches taken by more recent and "modern" IEMs. Yacht10's tuning lends vocals and instruments a heightened sense of clarity and tactility. It also slightly "diffuses" the center image (i.e., where main singer stands) to create a convincing illusion that the center of the stage hangs at the front of the head or before the eyes. However, if you come from a Harman-tuned or "Harman-inspired" IEM, you will need at least one song for your brain to adjust to the very different ear-gain compensation approach. On the plus side, when you come back to your Harman-tuned IEM, you would also find it weird and need adjustment time.

The treble of Yacht10 is probably the weakest point in its response. One of the problem is treble extension. Whilst Yacht10 does not sound muted nor the note decays feel abruptedly cut off, it does not have a strong response in the upper treble region, meaning its ability to pin point location and distance of sound elements is nothing out of ordinary. There is also a peak at 5-6kHz, which can be uncomfortable if you are particularly sensitive in this region. FYI, some tuners choose to cut this region (i.e., the so-called "sibilant dip"), trading the sense of tactility and clarity for a more easy-going sound signature. If your music has sibilance around 6kHz region, you might have problem with those recordings. Personally, I didn't have any problem with harshness or siblance in my tests, even with harsher rock recordings.

**Percussion, Bass, and perceived dynamic:** The bass, on the other hand, is the probably the brightest spot in Yacht10's response. It's snappy, tactile, precise, yet impactful. For example, stick impacts on snare drums feel like tactile tapping in my ears. Tracks with strong sense of rhythm carried by large drums, like the OST of The Ghost of Tsushima, are where Yacht10 shines the most. There is just enough subbass to ensure there is enough rumble, but not too much that makes the bassline sluggish. 

![](/assets/images/HiBy-Yacht10/Yacht10_53.jpg)

**Resolution:** The resolution of Yacht10 is rather surprising, especially when we consider that it has only one dynamic driver. Music always sounds clear and incisive with this IEM, meaning instruments rarely overlap and overshadow each other, making it easy for me to track and trace individual ones. To put in context, Yacht10 noticeably out-resolves the venerable Moondrop Aria 2021 and matches the Moondrop Blessing 2, which features a hybrid topology. 

The details within the midrange, especially voices, are also well presented by Yacht10. I think the overall detail retrieval is only held back by the weak treble extension, which dimmed the nuances and the "ambience" built into detail-rich recordings.

**Stereo imaging and soundstage:** Let's start with the positive: Yacht10 has wide and open soundstage. Listening to this IEM feels like sitting in a room with open windows. It's breezing, comfortable, spacious. Where Yacht10 tumbles, for me, is the depth illusion of the stage. Simply put, the contrast between near and far elements in a mix are not strong. As a result, the soundstage feels like a 2D plane between two ears rather than a 3D sphere around and within the head. As a result, I find it's rather hard to use Yacht10 in FPS games, as it does not convey and distinguish the position of sounds coming from the front very well.

Comparisons
===

All comparisons were done using HiBy R6 Pro Max as the source device and high-res or red book files as listening material. 

![](/assets/images/HiBy-Yacht10/vsAria.png)

**Moondrop Aria 2021:** We start our comparisons with one of the classics. Using Folsom Blue by Johnny Cash (live at Folsom Prison in January 1968) as the test track, four differences stood out: (1) Yacht10 is much more sensitive than Aria (volume 26/100 vs 37/100), (2) the voice of Johnny Cash is much more emphasised, crisp, and detailed with Yacht10, (3) the drum line feels much more "snappy" on Yacht10, (4) the background is cleaner with more space between sounds in the mix with Yacht10, making the stage more open and holographic. Unless you prefer a more mild and soft sonic presentation, I would say this comparison is a one-sided battle favouring Yacht10.

![](/assets/images/HiBy-Yacht10/vsBlessing2.png)

**Moondrop Blessing 2:** Let's continue our comparisons with another classic. For this comparison, I listened to Man in Black by Johnny Cash. Right of the bat, I found three differences: (1) Yacht10 is, again, more sensitive than Blessing 2 (27/100 vs 37/100), (2) the bass notes are noticeably more snappy and tactile on Yacht10, and (3) the tone of Johnny's voice is very different. His voice sounds a bit thin and shouty on Blessing 2, and more natural on Yacht10. In terms of detail retrieval in the midrange region and the separation of instruments, I found Yacht10 and Blessing 2 practically identical.

![](/assets/images/HiBy-Yacht10/Yacht10_28.jpg)
![](/assets/images/HiBy-Yacht10/vsEA1000.png)

**Simgot EA1000:** For the next comparison, let's revisit one of the high-performing DD-based IEM from Simgot, the famed EA1000. For this comparison, I continue my journey through the songs of Johnny Cash with the funny "I've Been Everywhere." For the first time in this comparison, we have an IEM more sensitive than Yacht10: EA1000 requires 30/100 on my R6 Pro Max whilst Yacht10 requires 32/100. In terms of tonality, I found Johnny's voice a bit thin and edgy with EA1000 and more natural and enjoyable with Yacht10. The bass is another area where Yacht10 has a clear edge over EA1000. The bass line is just "bigger", more impactful and noticeably more toe-tapping with Yacht10, compared to the more reserved presentation bass presentation of EA1000. Both IEMs aim for a snappy and tight bass presentation, but Yacht10 just a step ahead. On the other hand, the position of instruments on the stage feels slightly more focused with EA1000. The passive radiator firing against the concha of the ears in EA1000 also creates an interestingly uncanny sensation with instruments panned hard to the side channels. Still, in general, I would say EA1000 and Yacht10 are practically identical in terms of technical performance.

![](/assets/images/HiBy-Yacht10/Yacht10_46.jpg)
![](/assets/images/HiBy-Yacht10/vsFalcon.png)

**Dunu Falcon Ultra:** Falcon Ultra is another well-regarded and modern DD-based IEM. For this comparison, I listen to John Denver's "Perhaps Love". The tonality of the midrange, particularly the voice of John Denver, immediate stood out when I switch between these IEMs. It's rather hard to describe the difference, but I found that whenever I switch IEM, the next one would sound unnatural for about 30 seconds until my brain gets used to the new signature. I attribute this difference to the difference in the ear-gain compensation between these IEMs. Falcon Ultra follows a Harman-like curve whilst Yacht10 "hollows out" the region around 3kHz, leading to a more "diffused" sensation. Your preference and even ear anatomy would determine your preference in this case. In terms of technical performance, I found that Yacht10 has a slight edge over Falcon Ultra in terms of details and instrument separation. The bass is also more snappy on Yacht10. But on a macro level, I would say these IEMs are very close in terms of technical performance. The tonal difference would be the determining factor to choose one over the other.

![](/assets/images/HiBy-Yacht10/Yacht10_32.jpg)
![](/assets/images/HiBy-Yacht10/vsSingolo.png)

**KiwiEars Singolo:** Singolo is a pretty interesting IEM, at least in theory, with a filter-less design and 3D printed bass tube. For this comparison, I listen to one of my favourites, "I Walk The Line" by Johnny Cash. Firstly, Yacht10 is much more sensitive than Singolo (30/100 vs 38/100). Secondly, the voice of Johnny as well as the present of all instruments in the mix are noticeably more incisive, with more details with Yacht10. Interestingly, the bassline of Singolo does not fall behind Yacht10 noticeably in both quality and quantity. However, when I consider the whole sonic presentation, I think Yacht10 offers a more compelling and refined sound.

![](/assets/images/HiBy-Yacht10/Yacht10_41.jpg)
![](/assets/images/HiBy-Yacht10/vsSplendor.png)

**Intuaura Splendor II:** Splendor II is another new and capable single DD IEM with a fun sound signature. In this comparison, I listened to the hilarious song "A Boy named Sue" by Johnny Cash. The immediate difference that I heard was the clarity of the midrange: the voices and instruments sound clearer on Yacht10, to the point of making Splendor II feel muffled. The bass line also feels tighter and more precise on Yacht10. However, Splendor II has its charm with its thicker bass notes and just a more "dense" presentation in general. In terms of sensitivity, both IEMs require the same amount of volume to reach the same perceived loudness. 

![](/assets/images/HiBy-Yacht10/Yacht10_33.jpg)
![](/assets/images/HiBy-Yacht10/Yacht10_34.jpg)
![](/assets/images/HiBy-Yacht10/Yacht10_35.jpg)
![](/assets/images/HiBy-Yacht10/vs145.png)

**Hidizs MP145:** For the last comparison, I choose an IEM equipped with a full-ranged planar magnetic driver. For this comparison, I listen to "Dreamland Express" by John Denver. Firstly, as expected, Yacht10 is more sensitive than MP145 (31/100 vs 36/100). Superficially, I found that the overall tonality, presentation, and resolution of these IEMs are quite similar. However, upon close inspections, there are still some small but important differences. For example, the subbass is more emphasised on MP145, so you will hear more prominent bass guitar on this IEM. The voice of John Denver sits further away and ever-so-slightly more muffled on MP145. And of course, there is a particular "sandpaperry" texture in the midrange of MP145, a common issue of many IEMs sporting these 14.x mm planar magnetic drivers.

Conclusions
===

HiBy started their new IEM series with a bang. I like how the tuning of Yacht10 perfectly blends the old-school V-shaped tonality with the more sensible tuning in the lower midrange that is increasingly used by modern IEMs. Combining this tonality with a snappy, tactile, dynamic presentation and an open soundstage, Yacht10 presents a compelling sonic package. Yes, there are still places to improve, particularly in the treble extension and just the overall evenness of the treble response. However, I think it's safe to expect that these problems would be smoothened out when other drivers are introduced to take over the treble response in higher-end model of the Yacht series. If you are looking for the first "nice" IEM to start your own IEM journey, Yacht10 receives a recommendation from this reviewer.

**What I like about this IEM:**

- Snappy, tactile, and toe-tapping bass response
- Interesting and balance tonality, without sounding like another target-following IEM
- Technical performance is surprisingly solid
- Spacious soundstage
- Generous and useful accessories
- Interesting design

**What could be improved:**

- There are instances of sibilance and treble sharpness
- Soundstage depth and front-to-back positioning could be improved
- Treble extension could be improved
- I cannot get a good fit with any of the stock tips
