Hello, and welcome to In-ear Gems. I hope you enjoy your stay.

I made this website after realising that I would not be able to stop at one in-ear monitor (IEM) or stop talking about these little ones. On this website, I want to share what I learn and what I think about IEMs as I go deeper down the rabbit hole of this hobby. I also want to share the reviews of IEMs in my collection in a way that I hope to be instructive and helpful for your own journey of finding your IEM gems. 

What's so great about IEM anyway? I can list several reasons:
- They sound great: IEMs tend to have great details and impactful bass. 
- They can be beautiful: Some IEMs look like gemstones. Others have beautiful leather carrying cases and silver cables. Is look everything? Of course not, but it feels good to have a beautiful gadget around.
- They are intricate and intriguing: I'm particularly impressed by IEMs equipped with multiple miniature drivers of different types: Balanced Amature, Dynamic, Planar, Electro-static driver, and Bone conductor. 
- Finally, and most importantly, they are small and portable. Hi-fi in the pocket, you might say. Whenever and wherever you are, IEMs can always offer you a small measure of peace from the noisy and chaotic world.

If I have managed to convince you, then let's go. I suggest starting with my [ranking database](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w93T-HzERQvHM-oMtScW9eAUQZeK4AFHNUBg4WVFIc8/edit?usp=sharing) and have a look at my [review method](/methodology).
