This is where Yu9 Que differs the most from Cantor: it has that 6kHz cut. And that dip makes all the differences with some harsh recordings. (That and the healthy subbass boost)

Other than that, the midrange is surprisingly AFUL-like.The voices are upfront when they need to, but they don't have that thin and laser focused tone of Harman and VDSF tuned IEMs. They sound natural rather than having a warm, coloured lower midrange like some western IEMs and some Penon / ISN with the "hump" extends all the way from bass region to around 1kHz. Yet, voices (particularly clear if you listen to John Denver) have that subtle "sweetness" and texture to it. All of these can be explained by the careful contrast between upper midrange and lower midrange (always 5-7dB) combined with the early eargain boost at 1.5kHz.

How come they don't sound honky if they have early boost at 1.5kHz, you ask? They do. If you switch from a Harman IEM to AFUL or Yu9, you will feel a bit of honkiness in the first 30 seconds before your brain adjusts.
