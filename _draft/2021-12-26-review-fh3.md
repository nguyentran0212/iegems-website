> tl;dr: Deceptively good, very convincing in the showroom. However, the facade does fall apart upon close inspection: below average detail and poor soundstage depth. Still, for some genres of music, these drawbacks do not matter given how good FH3 is at subbass and separation. The included accessories are also pretty generous.

Detailed review coming soon...
