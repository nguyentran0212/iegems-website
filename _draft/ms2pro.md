# General information of the IEM

This is an entry-level hybrid IEM from Hidizs with a 1BA + 1DD driver topology

Details about the DD:
- 10.2mm diameter. 
- The diaphragm is made of PU+PEEK with a DLC (diamond-like coating) layer.
- Dual magenetic circuit design with N52 magnets

Details about the BA:
- Hidizs calls this Silvercore BA driver. (Very few available information. Likely a custom designed driver)
- This BA driver is a high frequency tweeter, 
- placed right in the IEM nozzles

Details regarding design of IEM shells:
- ZA12 Zinc Alloy Shell & Mirror Finish
- Rhinohide Leather Texture Panel

This IEM also includes the technology Hidizs calls "Pneumatic Sound Tube Technology"
- Essentially, the nozzles (or sound tube, in Hidizs term) can be unscrewed and replaced
- Hidizs can use different types dampening foams and filters to adjust the airflow in front of the DD, which in turn creates subtle shifts in the frequency response
- They include 3 sets of sound tubes in the box:
    - (White filter) High (Crystal Clear): Airy & detailed – ACG / Classical
    - (Red filter) Balanced (Charm Red): Warm & emotional – Pop / Folk
    - (Black filter) Bass (Midnight Black): Thunderous & deep – Rock / Metal

Specs:
- Impedance 17ohm
- Sensitivity: 111dB

# Experience and Impressions

I have been using this IEM on and off for nearly a month at this point (not every single day, but I kept it nearby all the time for quick tests and comparisons, plus I daily drove this IEM for while.)

I think the shells of this IEM are quite well designed. They feel a bit hefty in hands, but they are decently comfortable in ears. The fit is alright, though not can be a bit tricky to find a balance between stable fit, sound quality, and long-term wearing comfort. I find that softer and shorter tips, like the white silicone tips included in the box provides this balance, at least for me. 

Personally, I also think that the shells of MS2 Pro are quite pretty. the choice of using faux leather on the faceplate, combining with the mirror finish, was a good idea. The IEM looks quite premium, yet elegant, not gaudy, thanks to this design choice.

The cable is very very annoying. It's too flimsy, and I find that the left and right side can easily tangle when the IEM and cable are coiled up in the bag. Almost every time I take this IEM out of the carrying pouch, I have to untangle the cable. Hidizs should include a different cable next time.

Regarding noise isolation I found that Isolation is … okay. Usable, but it’s still a rather open IEM, so noise would pass thorough more readily

Regarding comfort, I found this IEM to be quite comfortable in long listening session, if you manage to find suitable ear tips for it. Hidizs provides two types of ear tips in the box. I found that the white, soft ones work better with my ears than the black ones. 



## My initial impressions regarding sound

These are my impressions of the sound after the first few days.

It's definitely a Hidizs IEM, and definitely a 1+1 config. Fans of DITA Project M IEM would find some familiar characteristics, but directed along a slightly different path.

As a Hidizs IEM, it has good bass, thicker than usual lower mid, with high mid and treble piercing through the veil. It's an exciting V-shaped sound that works well with some and less well with other tracks. 

You can definitely hear the DD across the range, with thumping bass very similar to the previous Hidizs (the MK12, wasn't it? The jellyfish one). At the other end, you hear the treble (like true treble, 8khz and up) rising with a distinct "timbre" that I have no other terms to describe besides the vague "BA timbre".

There this Hidizs does well, but Project M failed to convince me, is how much the treble there is. The Hidizs pushes very close to the uncanny valley, especially with cymbals and hats. However, it never really crossed the line. Meanwhile, the Project M fully jumps into the outright coloured treble that I couldn't reconcile despite trying to listen to it every day.

What's the evidence of treble push, you ask? Well, the graph will show. But subjectively, this treble manifests in a high soundstage and kinda uncanny, brittle high notes. The soundstage of this HIdizs has the same effect as the Meze Advar: everything seems to float up above the head. Like you sit down on the floor, and music plays somewhere above you. It gives an interesting, if not realistic soundstage.

Anyhow, it's a different sounding IEM. They do have a positive out of the box impression that I think would serve Hidizs well if they can sell these in physical audiophile store. When I switch to my critical listening mode, some cracks do appear, but not deal breaker yet. Just different.




## Further impressions about the sound by the end of the testing period

As I use the IEM more, I found some small issues with the sound that were not apparent on the first day.

Regarding the bass, I think it is good in terms of the amount of bass I can hear. Bass notes feel thick, like there is a sense of air being pushed against the ear drums. However, I found that the note attacks of the bass not very crisp (i.e., the bass does not feel very "fast"), and the details and texture in the decay-end of the bass note is just okay. I don't like to use the phrase "good for the price" in my reviews because it feels like a backhanded compliment, but this phrase is a good way to think about the bass of MS2 Pro.

Regarding the tonality, I think it could be somewhat divisive. Simply put, if your ears have become very used to the more neutral tuning of current batch of IEMs, you might find the midrange tonality of MS2 Pro a bit uncanny. Somehow, it manages to be both slightly muffled and slightly hollow at the same time. For example, female vocals feel like there they are covered by a thin blanket of warmth. The voice can sound somewhat hollow and distant, especially at mid or lower volume level. However, certain high notes would cut through this "blanket". In other words, there is a sense of unevenness in the tonality of MS2 Pro. Would it matter to you? Depends. When I talk to others, most people don't seem to be bothered by this tonality, whilst some others have very strong negative response. 



# Detailed analysis of sound quality

## Tonality

Superficially, we can consider this sound signature a variation of the old-school V-shaped signature that were popular with both western and ChiFi IEM in the Shure SE215 era. 

This IEM sounds exactly like how it graphs on frequency response graph.

There is not distinct bass shelf. Instead, the midbass at 150Hz smoothly merge into the lower midrange at 250Hz to create a hump that extends all the way to the midrange at 800Hz. This partially explain why the bass attack do not feel very crisp and precise. The fact that lower midrange is around 2.5dB above the lowest point at the midrange explains the warmth "blanket" that I mentioned in the subjective impression.

At the other side of the spectrum, we have a sensible upper midrange boost for ear gain compensation, reaching around 9dB. You might find that this level of upper midrange boost is quite sensible vs old V-shaped IEM. That's why MS2 Pro does not sound too shrill or shouty, which is a good thing.

The mid-midrange is sandwiched between bass hump and ear gain. Therefore, depending on the volume level that you choose, you might find the core elements of the midrange a bit hollow or distant. 

Moving up the frequency response, we see two sizable peaks at around 4kHz and 8kHz. These two give the treble region that crisp, almost brittle sensation that I described. The 8kHz might also be responsible for the nice illusion of stage height for this IEM. 

The upper treble region, on the other hand, is quite subdued, thus quite a bit of nuances are lost. 

On my rating scale from 1 (poor) to 5 (outstanding), I'll put the tonality of MS2 Pro as 3 (average). It's workable, but with drawbacks. 


## Bass and dynamic

MS2 Pro has good amount of bass, thus does a good job at conveying the sense of dynamic. So, from the perspective of bass power, MS2 Pro is okay.

However, I think the bass quality could be more refined. It does not feel particularly tight or textured, which negatively impact the sense of rhythm and beat.

On my rating scale regarding bass and dynamic between 1 and 5, I rate MS2 Pro 3 (average)



## Resolution

MS2 Pro is smack dab average. You hear most of the surface levels details in the mix (like, all instruments that are supposed to be there in the mix would be there, and there is not much blurriness in the separation between them in more busy section of the mix). You can hear some micro details if you pay attention, and the amount of details is relatively okay on its own, unless you do comparisons, but at the same time, it is not super detailed or nuanced. 

On my rating scale, I rate the resolution of MS2 Pro a 3/5 (average)




## Soundstage and imaging

The hollow-out midrange of this IEM gives it an advantage in the perceived size of soundstage. Most of the time, the soundstage of this IEM feels spacious and open. There is a good sense of width. Due to the hollow-out of the midrange and the thicker lower mid and bass, some tracks would also reveal a good sense of depth contrast as well. The sense of height is also good thanks to the treble. For example, cymbals and hi-hats can sound like they hover slightly above my head, making the stage feels tall. The main limitation of the stage of MS2 Pro is that it does not sound particularly precise in terms of the positioning. It's like, I can tell that sound elements come from certain direction or position on the stage, but it's hard to pin point with laser focus. 

On my rating scale, I rate the soundstage and imaging of MS2 Pro a 3.5/5 (above average). The extra 0.5 above average is due to the spacious sensation of its soundstage.





# My overall thought about this IEM

I think it's something different, in the age where IEMs are tuned more and more similar. Depending on your taste, and how deeply embedded you are in the IEM hobby in the lat several years, you might find this difference refreshing or too much of a contrast to enjoy. Beside the tone, I think the overall technical performance of this IEM is average in the grand scheme, but seem rather decent for the price. I think the earpieces are well designed from both aesthetic and wearing comfort perspectives. The only major complain I have for Hidizs is the stock cable. It's horrible.

Would I recommend? I think there are a few archetypes of users:
- If you are very new to the IEM hobby and buying a DAP from Hidizs and wonder whether you should get this IEM as well as a part of package deal, I think it's not a bad option, especially if the discount is good. If you pair this IEM with another neutral IEM, you would have a complete starter setup that gives you variety
- If you are a veteran in the entry-level segment of IEM hobby who has bought a lot of sets, the question is what you think about the current tuning of IEMs? If the idea of "meta" tuned IEM not appealing, maybe adding something different like this one could spice things up. If you think the midrange is already perfect with the "meta" tuned IEM, this MS2 Pro might sound odd to you.
