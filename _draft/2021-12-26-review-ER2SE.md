> tl;dr: Clean and detailed. ER2SE is a microscope for you to dissect your music.  Isolation is also top notch. However, it is not the most convenient IEM out there, and it makes everything sound crammed due to its tiny soundstage. Still, should you add it to your collection? Big yes.

Detailed review coming soon...
