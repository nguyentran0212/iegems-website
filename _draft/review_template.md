> tl;dr: An average yet hard to beat performer. It is relaxing and warm, but also a bit fuzzy, mushy, especially in the bass. However, you wouldn't recognize these problems unless you have listened to outright better ones, and those wouldn't cost the same as Aria. 

# Preample

- I purchase this unit on my own. I have no affiliation with or financial interest in ???
- All listening tests were conducted at a around 65 db. 
- My music library covers nostalgic pop music, epic orchestral music from Sci-fi shows, classical violin performances, piano, lo-fi beats, and a few rock songs.
- What I look for in IEM, in order of importance: strong sense of depth with elements in a mix layering from closer to further away, clear separation between elements, detailed and textured elements, snappy and tactile note attacks in bass and midrange, natural timbre. 
- IEMs are rated with a series of A/B tests against a few benchmark IEMs. The total rating is the average of component ratings. EQ is NOT used in these tests. See the [methodology](/methodology) for more detail.

# Sound Analysis

## Percussion Control

> **Percussion control** reflects an IEM's ability to render drums and other instruments tha maintain rhythm and tempo of a mix. IEMs with good percussion control can keep up with fast and complex rhythm without blurring the beats together. IEMs with excellent percussion control also gives a tactile "snap" to percussion attacks. Percussion control is determined by both bass and treble tuning. 

## Detail

> **Detail Retrieval** reflects an IEM's ability to reveal fine details in a mix. IEMs with good detail retrieval render background elements such as the backing vocal, string ensemble in the background, and reverbs clearly. They also reveal more micro contrast and little vibrations in the trailing end of notes.

## Separation and Layering

> **Separation and layering** reflects an IEM's ability to render elements in a mix distinctively. IEMs with excellent separation and layering can separate elements from left to right as well as from front to back.

## Spatial Illusion

> **Spatial illusion** reflects an IEM's ability to construct an imaginary sound field around a listener's head. IEMs with excellent spatial illusion create a dome-like and open soundstage around listener's head.

## Tonality

> **Tonality** reflects the timbre and relative loudness of different elements in a mix. I assess IEM's tonality based on how bad they are rather than how good they are. As long as the tuning does not make timbre unrealistic nor reduce technical performance significantly, it is acceptable.
