# Preample

- I purchase this unit on my own. I have no affiliation with or financial interest in ???.
- All listening tests were conducted at around 65 dB. 
- My music library covers nostalgic pop music, epic orchestral music from Sci-fi shows, classical violin performances, piano, lo-fi beats, and a few rock songs.
- What I look for in IEM, in order of importance: a strong sense of depth with elements in a mix layering from closer to further away, clear separation between elements, detailed and textured elements, snappy and tactile note attacks in bass and midrange, natural timbre. 
- IEMs are rated with a series of A/B tests against a few benchmark IEMs. The total rating is the average of component ratings. EQ is NOT used in these tests. See the [methodology](/methodology) for more detail. 
- Eartips can change the insertion depth of an IEM, which in turn changes its soundstage and frequency response. I try to insert IEMs to rest against the concha of my ears unless indicated otherwise.

![???? vs benchmark IEMs](/assets/images/reviews/compare-titan-s.png)

This table shows the results of A/B tests between ??? and the benchmark IEMs. +1 means ??? wins. -1 means ??? loses. 0 means draw. Some tests are too one-sided that conclusions can be reached without further tests. 

## Percussion Control: ???/5

> **Percussion control** reflects an IEM's ability to render drums and other instruments that maintain the rhythm and tempo. IEMs with good percussion control can keep up with fast and complex rhythms without blurring the beats together. IEMs with excellent percussion control also gives a tactile "snap" to percussion attacks. Percussion control is determined by both bass and treble. 

Song list:
- [MS Gundam: Iron-blooded Orphans](https://open.spotify.com/track/4VrKSDOKLD9dRkeLScYfPD?si=77b3b26533e9472d) (1:10 to 1:35): focus on the timing and composure of the bass line during busy section.
- [INFINITY](https://open.spotify.com/track/2ws1dIEMyUCNiqoB0tIyXw?si=58852728badb4342) (0:40 to 1:05): focus on the timing of bass and cymbal.
- [Imperial March](https://open.spotify.com/track/7dO9OAZUF4LIK5iZ1gROW3?si=f2643c07408d484a) (0:00 to 0:45): focus on the timing of percussion and double bass.

Decision on final rating.

## Detail, Texture, and Micro-dynamic: ??/5

> **Detail, Texture, and Micro-dynamic** reflect an IEM's ability to render fine details in individual elements of a mix. IEMs with excellent detail retrieval render vocal and instruments clearly and reveal small details such as breaths, small vibratos, and the subtle reverb at the end of a musical phrase. They can make the violin section in an orchestra sound like a collection of violins playing together rather than a blob of sound. They also render background elements such as backing vocal and orchestra clearly.

Song list:
- [I have a dream - remix](https://open.spotify.com/track/27MwRZAo8jDXfdHFx8E6cX?si=b013815e147a4810) (0:50 to 1:20): focusing on small elements and backing vocal in the background of the mix.
- [Memories](https://open.spotify.com/track/0PezhWEYlDODxIAKefyINk?si=942f4efd10364c21) (0:00 - 0:21): focusing on the texture and micro-details of the guitar.
- [My Heart Will Go On](https://open.spotify.com/track/33LC84JgLvK2KuW43MfaNq?si=a559df67fdd143b2) (0:00 to 0:40): focusing on the texture and micro-details of the voice, especially the last words of each phrase.

## Separation and Layering: ??/5

> **Separation and layering** reflects an IEM's ability to distinctively render elements in a mix. IEMs with excellent separation and layering can separate elements from left to right and from front to back, minimising the overlap between them. 

![Separation and Layering](/assets/images/separation-layering.png)

Song list:
- [And the waltz goes on](https://open.spotify.com/track/6gvQHafvp7j7eanVD269Jj?si=b23ed34b8e7840f3) (0:50 - 0:15): focus on the layering and separation of the instrument.
- [Beethoven Symphony No. 5 Mvmt 1](https://open.spotify.com/track/4mw5oRBKNBfNV0dXAOIcne?si=dfd0770f575a4307) (0:00 to 0:30): focus on the sharpness of instruments, layering of woodwind over the string, and the panning of string from right to the left channel.
- [Waltz 2](https://open.spotify.com/track/0pjCsB0XNSyqM9UazlTODC?si=1d2977189fbf446a) (0:35 - 1:00): focus on the separation and layering of woodwind over string over percussion.

## Spatial Illusion: ??/5

> **Spatial illusion** reflects an IEM's ability to construct an imaginary sound field around a listener's head. IEMs with excellent spatial illusion create a dome-like and open soundstage around the listener's head.

![Soundstage](/assets/images/soundstage.png)

Song list:
- [Danger Zone](https://open.spotify.com/track/34x6hEJgGAOQvmlMql5Ige?si=df966c1603864c67) (0:00 - 0:50): focus on the centre of the soundstage to see how much it is pushed away from the head.
- [Presto](https://open.spotify.com/track/5jWKziVgN8Bq1Mjrw9hbUt?si=bb3a3fd523ff420f) (0:00 to 0:40): focus on the reverb. Does it wrap around the head or appear inside the head?
- [Shaker test](https://open.spotify.com/track/2ichfXkILYFJEhk0z8ULAm?si=55e977db2576477d): for drawing out the overall shape of the soundstage.

## Tonality: ??/5

> **Tonality** reflects the timbre and relative loudness of different elements in a mix. I assess IEM's tonality based on how bad they are rather than how good they are. As long as the tuning does not make timbre unrealistic nor reduce technical performance significantly, it is acceptable.

## Personal Preference ??/5

> Personal preference is my entirely subjective and personal opinion about an IEM, based on multiple factors. This score DOES NOT contribute to the rating of an IEM.



# Upgrade path

Should you get ??? if ...
- *you have no IEM?* 
- *you have a not-so-great budget IEM?* 
- *you already have something decent like Aria?* 
- *you already have Blessing 2 or higher-end IEM?* 
- *you want head-shaking, thick, boomy sound?* 

Where to go from ????
- *More clarity?* 
- *More immersive soundstage?* 
- *More impactful bass?*
