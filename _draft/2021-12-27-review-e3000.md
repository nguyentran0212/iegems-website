> tl;dr: E3000 is warm and relaxing. It has surprisingly good detail retrieval due to a smooth tuning that is devoid of auditory masking. Another surprise of E3000 is layering - the ability to put elements of a mix at different distance from the listener. If you have an E3000, turn the volume up more than usual because Final has reduced its sensitivity to achieve all of these goodness.

Detailed review coming soon...
