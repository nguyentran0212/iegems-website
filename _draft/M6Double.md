The battery drains quite fast with the JAN tube on. To give you a subjective impression, here is how the battery looks like to me. In the morning, I arrived at the office, setup my IEM, connect USB cable, and turn on the DAC: battery has no charge. The IEM makes a scary noise when I try to play music from the DAC in this mode. So, the DAC goes to my 100W charger. I leave it along, I think, for roughly 2 hours until the DAC reports that it is fully charged. I connect the DAC to PC again after lunch break with full charge and be very happy with the sound. Around 5:30 or 6:00 when I pack up, I check the battery again. It's already has zero charge left on the display, though it still limps on for a while longer.
