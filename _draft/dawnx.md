## Technologies inside DawnX (as described by AFUL)

The way AFUL implements various approaches to solve specific engineering problem to achieve a target sound has always interest me over the years. This IEM is no differnce.

AFUL expertise on 3D printing and crossover design makes a come back with DawnX, as expected. This time, they push the crossover to a full 6-way electronic, 6-way physical. Last time with Cantor, it was more like 7-way electronic but 5-way physical. So, in some sense, this is the evolution and refinement along the same path of AFUL, something that is to be expected, in my opinion. Good to see, never the less. 

The high-damping air pressure balance system is also back. I argue that it works better than the implementation in the older Performer 8. I can hear some characteristics in the bass quality, particulalry the sense of "free vibration", and nuances and texture in the bass response. However, DawnX has more satisfying amount of bass. So, in this sense, I would say this technology has also been evolved. Good to see. 

What's new with AFUL this time is the EST driver, in particular, how they do the EST. AFUL uses 4 Sonion EST drivers in this IEM, which is a bit of a rare choice since others tend to use 2EST for IEM in this price range. I guess 4EST driver is necessary as AFUL use these drivers to cover the treble region all the way from 5kHz up, rather than runing EST only for ultra high frequency. As a result, you can hear more influence of the EST on the sound of the IEM, rather than reserving IEM for "blink-and-you-miss" special effect. 

What puzzles me is the lack of details regarding the BCD. From the schematic, it seems that AFUL uses something similar to the BA-type BCD from Sonion. However, at this point, we have no confirmation. Quite puzzling. I certainly wish to know more about how AFUL implements BCD in DawnX.

# Impressions and experience

I have been using this IEM daily for more than a month now before writing this review.

I think I‚Äôm at the point when I‚Äôm very familiar with this dawnX IEM now. I just put it in the bag next to cantor, no case, and use it whenever and wherever needed. It feels more like a cozy warm hug vs Cantor. But both have a homely vibe, mostly because they don‚Äôt look for feel that expensive. I always felt uneasy to use high end IEMs like Anni and Spec because they felt ‚Ä¶ precious. These AFUL feel like ‚Äúmy IEMs‚Äù. I also like the utilitarian vibe of 64 audio IEMs. Tools, not ‚Äúmy preciousssss‚Äù

I think it‚Äôs easy to like, difficult to hate, and has the technical performance expected from a multi-kilobuck class IEM despite the low key presentation.

$1300 set that is safe, correct, and high technical performance is actually gold for most people who want a multi kilobuck but cannot audition before buying. Better safe than sorry.

## First Impressions

First, let's talk about the easy part of the impression: tuning. It's easy to talk about because it is an AFUL IEM. It's tuned exactly like how you would expect an AFUL IEM to sound: forward midrange (the voice is rarely buried in the mix, unless it is the artist's design), natural and, dare I say, beautiful midrange. The bass is bigger than usual this time, but not by much. The treble is easier on the ears this time, despite scary-looking 6kHz on my rig. Either my rig over emphasise the 6kHz vs the calibrated rig of AFUL, or the EST drivers lend a softness to the treble. In this regard, Dawn-X behaves exactly like Anni 2023 in this region: generous treble, but not grainy or harsh or piercing. I tested 2 albums of Ed Sheeran and did not detect any sibilance or harshness problem.

Next, details and separation. Top notch. One step solid step above Cantor, in my opinion in terms of both separation and micro details. It's just so effortless for me to listen to everything in a recording. Instruments have plenty of space between them so they don't step on each other's "toes". But it's micro details when the music gets quiet, when the sound fades into nothingness. That's where I hear small details that I have never heard before in the songs that I listen to on a daily basis with my Cantor and Yu9 Que.

AFUL has also glown up in the bass region. Bass guitar and drums are to die for. So much texture. So control. Without losing the sense power. I'm addicted to the drum and bass guitar with this IEM. Every beat is heard and felt, and if there is bass guitar playing with the same beat as the drum, you will hear precise what the bass guitar plays, down to the small vibration. That said, you still don't have the same indulgent bass as Anni 2023 or Spectrumica. This is bass boosted rather than bass head.

The sense of dynamic is obviously good. I would say AFUL has fixed the dynamic problem after P8, so there is not much to comment here.

Where Dawn-X does shockingly well is the soundstage imaging. If there is an IEM that I can describe at "holographic", this would be the one. No, it will not sound like VR headset that places you in a realistic environment with sounds all around you. No, it's IEM soundstage on steroid. The center of the stage is strictly anchor in your head or slightly in front of your eyes, so you don't need to worry about too distant midrange. However, it's the background elements of the stage that carry the magic. Eventhough the center of the stage is strictly in your skull, the "wall" or boundary of the stage feel like it can expand as far as it needs into the room, tricking you into thinking that some sound come from the room itself. Combining this with the usual echoey shennanigan of bone conduction driver that can give the illusion of side channels floating outside the ears on the sides of the face, and you have an immersive and impressive listening experience.

Some recordings in my collection made me breathless with Dawn-X:

    Now We Are Free by 2CELLOS
    Winter violin concerto performed by Janine Jansen and orchestra
    The whole Ghost of Tsushima, particular "The Fate of Tsushima" and "Jin Sakai"
    Country Road, Take Me Home by John Denver



Where I'm not happy so far: the fit.

I guess we simply cannot have thin and narrow nozzles like usual given the number of sound tubes inside this thing, but the nozzle is quite a bit larger than usual. The comfort is way lower than Cantor and P7 for me.

Edit: forgot to mention: this IEM is quite insensitive. I need quite a bit higher volume level than usual. That said, R3 Pro II handles this IEM easily.



## Description of accessories plus my opinion

You know, the other day I was throwing boxes away and I picked up the DawnX box again. And when I check the accessories, I was like ‚Äúit does not really miss anything, actually‚Äù. Case with padding and fake leather? Check. Many types of ear tips? Check. Leather cable tie? Check. Cleaning brush? Check. Interchangeable plug? No, but personally I avoid that kind of cable. Just me.

It‚Äôs just they box everything in such a generic and space saving way (put everything in the IEM case to shrink down the box). Practically, it‚Äôs not lacking.

But more than $500 for an IEM is not practical decision at all. So you are right, I want that ‚Äúso unnecessary‚Äù packaging of bgvp.

Btw, that solomon packaging is even more extra than Spectrumica üëÄ


## Some other thoughts and experiments

Personally, it‚Äôs exactly how I want my endgame IEM to be. Tone is spot on. Treble is finally not that dependent on fit and it really does not sound like usual BA supertweeters. Noticeably more detailed and better separation than my current collection. And it has a really holographic stage now. Can‚Äôt fault it.

The only thing left I want more is the design and the cable. I wish it has a more signature design like Cantor rather than a generic black and red resin shell with generic looking chrome hardware. Cantor‚Äôs cable hardware is actually more elaborated.

I only listen to Polyphia so, I can‚Äôt say much about those heavy genres. But dawn x does Polyphia well. The bass carries the show here. The rest is just usual AFUL tone and balance. I also really like cymbal crashes of Dawn X. I think I like crashes here best across all I own, matching Anni and Spec. It‚Äôs not harsh, but it‚Äôs present, and the decay of the crash is crazy detailed. It‚Äôs small things, of course, but I was quite wowed by the treble decay.

Using DawnX to listen to some lofi mixed with rain sound. It‚Äôs immersive AF ü§≠ The rain was recorded under an umbrella, and the IEM picks up the spatial cue, so it feels like rain drops on my head.

That said, when I‚Äôm a bit mentally tired, lofi plus dawnX is like lullaby. I‚Äôm sleepy üòÇ

I find this IEM quite relaxing, but it draws my attention due to how it does bass, imaging, and details. Not quite suitable for background at work, since it‚Äôs harder to ‚Äútune out‚Äù than cantor to me.

Yeah, I think it‚Äôs easy to like, difficult to hate, and has the tech expected from a multi-kilobuck class despite the low key presentation.

# Selected Comparisons against other IEMs

## Against AFUL Cantor

It‚Äôs a solid step above Cantor on resolution front, and it does so without the sharp, hard edge treble. Separation is more effortlessly, and details in the decay end of the notes and background element are much more audible.

Hard to say which part of this IEM i like more, but I think the bass is no1 highlight, followed by the stage, and then resolution. Tonality is not that big of a deal, IMHO, because AFUL has always tuned their mid well from day one. This is just continuation of that tuning.

This IEM does not pull the midrange back to make the stage bigger like some MEST and some 64 audio. But, likely due to the treble extension, it expands the edge of the stage far into the room around me. Particularly when I listen to orchestral recording with horn or string or choral section in the background. There is a unique sense of holography to the soundstage. Kinda like I can reach out and grab some of the elements in the mix. 

## Against AFUL Performer 5+2

Why this comparison? Because I expected DawnX to be a direct upgrade of Performer 5+2 (let's call it P7 for short)

First thing I notice when A/B DawnX and P7 using my MuseHifi M6 Double DAC on tube mode is how insensitive DawnX is. I need to increase from 10 to 15 volume clicks to have perceptively matching loudness level. 

Sonic wise, I would say the tonality and overall tonal balance is quite close. DawnX is much closer to P7 than Cantor on this particular aspect. P7 feels quite a bit more trebly than DawnX.

Technical performance is, unsurprisingly, lean heavily towards DawnX. The best to way describe the difference is that DawnX is more precise on both micro details, instrument separation, and instrument placement on the virtual soundstage across the frequency spectrum. It's like moving from a 1080p to 1440p or 4k footage. You can see everything with 1080p, and the footage was quite sharp. But there is just more of that clarity and separation and micro details with the 4k footage. And I need to emphasise that DawnX achieves that information again without making the sound harsh or piercing in the treble region.

Speaking of treble, I found that trble of P7 feels significantly more "metallic" and harsh, yet revealing less nuances and detail than the 4 EST in DawnX

The stage of P7 does not have that cool "wrap around", "bubble aorund head" illusion like DawnX.

Of course, at this point, it's important to remember that P7 is still the "1080p" footage in this context. It's not a blurry, low-res IEM.

## Against 64 Audio U12T

This IEM was my benchmark for technical performance of IEM for years. How does it compare against DawnX?

The difference in tonality immediately stands out. DawnX feels like a smooth, cozy, even sound. U12T feels thin and brittle with some female vocal, due to the way its midrange around 1.5khz region is tuned, how it peaks at 2.5kHz and then immediately dip at 3kHz. Whilst U12T sounds fine on its, own, it feels hollow and artificial in this direct A/B comparison against both DawnX and P7.

Technical performance wise, I hear better resolution with DawnX. Both u12T and DawnX are quite resolving IEM, so it's not a big day and night difference, but I found that it is easier to follow different instruments, and I can hear more micro details with DawnX, whilst DawnX treble is smoother and easier to listen than U12T.

The soundstage of DawnX is also more impressive. It conveys the wraparound effect more clearly, and the distant elements in the mix sound more convincingly distant. 

Yes, I think my long-term benchmark IEM has been convincingly surpassed.

# Tonality and frequency response analysis deep dive

Tonal signature: neutral-warm with moderate bass boost.
- Neutral-warm here means the midrange tuning is even, balanced, fall within the realm of neutrality. However, it is slightly warmer than a usual neutral-flat midrange tuning. This effect is due to around 1.5dB lift in the lower midrange around 250Hz and more importantly the more reserved ear-gain boost, topping at only around 6dB (for context, Harman IEMs that sound thin and sharp can boost up to 12.5dB in the same ear gain region). More lower mid and less upper mid means the midrange of DawnX feels somewhat warm and "cozy". that said, it's still in the realm of neutral, not a significantly coloured and warm IEM. 
- Bass is around 8.5dB above the level of midrange. Because the bass is higher than upper midrange, you would hear more bass in music, thus DawnX can be classified as having a bass boost. However, the bass is still only 8.5db above midrange, so DawnX is not a "bass monster" or anything like that. There is bass, bass is emphasised, and bass has quite good quality in terms of impact and details, but it's not an IEM with overwhelming amount of bass
- Treble is present all the way to ultra high frequencies. Therefore, this IEM can have quite precise stereo imaging, the soundstage has great sense of height, micro details are prominent (i.e., all the good bits you expect from IEM with good treble presence). However, the treble is not harsh or piercing or "in your face". It's likely that this is the effect of EST drivers. This treble presentation gives this IEM a more "low-key" and relaxing vibe.

# Technical performance deep dive

## Resolution:

I would use two terms to describe its resolution: effortless and nuanced. 

Effortless because it is quite easy for me to listen to all different parts of the recordings, even a busy orchestral one with many elements. 

Nuanced because even in those busy passaged, if I want to, I can focus on any instrument and still be able to hear the nuances and details, such as the "snap" of violin bow catching the string, or the reed sound of clarinet, or the breathy sound and click clack of valves of concert flutes. 

To put in perspective, the resolution is at a higher level than both my 64 Audio U12T and my AFUL Cantor, the current benchmark for 5/5 level of resolution in my collection. 

And DawnX achieves all of this resolution whilst maintaining a low-key presentation, never harsh or piercing in the treble. 

## Dynamic

I think the way DawnX presents the bass instruments like bass guitar and drums is quite special, and personally, addictive. 

A fellow reviewer uses the term "airy" to describe the bass of DawnX, and I think it is a good description. Every bass note of DawnX has a sense of resonance, as if the enregy is allowed to spread out and decay naturally until the end rather than being compressed and surpressed. 

At the same time, the note attacks of bass instruments have a clean edge and a clear sense of physical impact that I can feel in the throat or the back of my head, depending on the recording. So, all of these factors together creates a satisfying bass presentation. When I give this IEM an epic orchestral score or a recording with good bass line, it can convey the beat and rhythm with full dynamic and engagement factor. So, from this perspective, I think this is an outstanding bass presentation. 

But if you are a "bass head", it's worth it to remember again that DawnX has only 8.5dB bass boost, so even if the bass is more emphasised in the mix, it does not have the highest amount of bass. Though you can remedy this by turning the volume up a few clicks vs your usual listening (not exaggeratedly so, just a few level higher). The way DawnX was tuned ensures that it works with higher volume.

In my personal ranking, which emphasis more on the sense of rhythm and quality of bass note, I would give DawnX a 4.5/5. I took 0.5 off the score because I think AFUL could have pushed this bass a few dB higher to really show case its quality. 

## Soundstage and imaging

The stage of DawnX feels three dimensional and usually convey an impression that my head is within a bubble of sound, extending outward in all direction. 

The illusion of height of the soundstage is very good. instruments like hi hats and cymbals tend to be positioned slightly above the head in a convincing way. 

The foreground elements in the mix (i.e., the ones more emphasised, such as main vocals, main instruments) still upfront and closer to me not burried in the mix or deliberately pushed further away to artificially enhance the illusion of large soundstage. So, because of this, DawnX might feel not as "roomy" as some other TOTL IEMs, but on the plus side, you would not feel that the music is too "distant".

Thanks to the EST and good upper treble presence, DawnX can still convincingly project the background elements of the track, such as distant choral section or string section further into the environment around me. In some recordings, it feels uncannily real that some parts of the recording actually comes from the surrounding room around me. Maybe the BCD also has a bit of influence in this. 

Speaking of BCD, DawnX also has the slightly uncanny effect that I observe with other IEMs that have BCD. In particular, instruments hard panned to the side channels can create the illusion that they float some where around the ears, as if I can reach out and grab them. 

All and all, I find DawnX's soundstage and imaging exceptional against my standards and reference IEMs. Therefore, I would give DawnX a full 5/5 on this regard as well.
