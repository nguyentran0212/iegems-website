Opening phrase

Forewords
===

- What I look for in an IEM is **immersion.** I want to feel the orchestra around my head, track individual instruments, and hear all of their textures and details. I'm not picky about tonality, as long as it is not make the orchestra, violin, cellos, and pianos sound wrong.
- I rate IEMs within with a consistent scale from **1 (Poor) to 3 (Good) to 5 (Outstanding)**. An overall ranking of 3/5 or above is considered positive. 
- Ranking list and measurement database are on [my IEM review blog](https://iegems.nk-tran.com/).
- Terms used in my reviews are consistent with the [glossary by Headphonesty](https://www.headphonesty.com/sound-description-glossary)

**Resolution:** *To me, "resolution" can be broken down into three components: (1) Sharpness, incisiveness, or "definition" of note attacks (see the figure above). (2) The separation of instruments and vocals, especially when they overlap on the soundstage. (3) The texture and details in the decay side of the notes. The first two give music clarity and make it easy to track individual elements of a mix. The last provides music details and nuances.*

**Stereo imaging and soundstage:** *Stereo imaging or "soundstage" is a psychoacoustic illusion that different recording elements appear at various locations inside and around your head. Your brain creates based on the cues in the recording, which are enhanced or diminushed by your IEMs, your DAC, and your amplifier. In rare cases, with some specific songs, some IEMs can trick you into thinking that the sound comes from the environment (a.k.a., "holographic")*

**Multimedia usage:**



Frequency Response Analysis
===

*Frequency response of Crimson against Helios and the Harman in-ear target. Measurements were done with an IEC-711-compliant coupler and might only be compared with other measurements from this same coupler. Above 8kHz, the measurement might not be correct. Visit my [graph database](https://nk-tran.com/iegems-graphtool/) for more comparisons.*

*It is helpful to think of an IEM as a filter that highlights or subdues different parts of the incoming audio signal. This effect can be measured objectively by the squiggly lines above, called Frequency Response (FR) graphs, which measure how loud an IEM is at different frequencies from 20Hz (bass) to 20kHz (upper treble). Subjectivity is how your ears and brain interpret the effect of that filter on your music and decide whether it is "enjoyable." There are some "rules of thumb" when it comes to tonality, but most interesting IEMs usually bend the rules masterfully.*
