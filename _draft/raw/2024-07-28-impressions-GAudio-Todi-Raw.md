- What I look for in an IEM is **immersion.** I want to feel the orchestra around my head, track individual instruments, and hear all of their textures and details. I'm not picky about tonality, as long as it is not make the orchestra, violin, cellos, and pianos sound wrong.
- I rate IEMs within with a consistent scale from **1 (Poor) to 3 (Good) to 5 (Outstanding)**. An overall ranking of 3/5 or above is considered positive. 
- Ranking list and measurement database are on [my IEM review blog](https://iegems.nk-tran.com/).

The subjective impression is captured using the lexicon in the Sound Wheel below. I'll clarify the terminology as I use them. If you want to see more details of the lexicon and related reference, please have a look at the technical report [ITU-R BS.2399-0](https://www.itu.int/pub/R-REP-BS.2399).

**Timbre:**  *It is helpful to think of an IEM as a filter that highlights or subdues different parts of the incoming audio signal. This effect can be measured objectively by the squiggly lines below, called Frequency Response (FR) graphs, which measure how loud an IEM is at different frequencies from 20Hz (bass) to 20kHz (upper treble). Subjectivity is how your ears and brain interpret the effect of that filter on your music and decide whether it is "enjoyable." There are some "rules of thumb" when it comes to tonality, but most interesting IEMs usually bend the rules masterfully.*

*Figure shows the frequency response of Todi against the Harman in-ear target. Measurements were done with an IEC-711-compliant coupler and might only be compared with other measurements from this same coupler. Above 8kHz, the measurement likely does not match the response at the ear drum. Visit my [graph database](https://nk-tran.com/iegems-graphtool/) for more comparisons.*

Overview of the timbre and tonal balance, with reference to the frequency response. Use the terminology of sound wheel.
- Timbral balance: dark-bright, full, homogeneous
- Midrange: nasal? canny? strength?
- Treble: brilliance, tinny? treble strength?
- Bass: bass strength? depth? boomy? boxy?

Overview of the tonality and timber of Todi:
- The sound signature of Todi does not fall neatly into any category. I would reluctantly consider its sound signature as "U-shaped"
- The unique feature of Todi is that it has no ear gain compensation at all. As a result, you need to turn the volume up higher, which in turn makes the lower and upper frequencies much more emphasised than the frequency response graph suggests. 
- The tonal balance of the midrange of Todi varies between tracks. Some orchestral tracks can sound relatively normal. In some other vocal tracks, the lower midrange can dominate the mix, creating a boxy and muffled sensation.
- The treble frequencies of Todi, especially the region where cymbals, hats, and vocal sibilance exist, are always highlighted above the midrange. Therefore, some siblant vocals (including voice over on YouTube) can sound muffled and sibilant at the same time.
- Todi fares much better with instrumental music.
- Where Todi shines is tracks like Playing God by Polyphia.

Next, let's take a closer look how Todi present various types of voices and instruments in some test tracks. The first track is [Shivers by Ed Sheeran](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2_Lrg6rRks), which is invaluable for checking the harshness and sibilance of an IEM, as well as its balance across the midrange frequencies. An IEM with ideal tonal balance would be able to control the harshness (e.g., starting from the chorus section) and imbue an emotive "warmth" to Ed's voice without making it muted or muffled. Here are key observations about how Todi performs with this track:
- Unfortunately, Todi makes the voice of Ed Sheeran both muffled and sibilant at the same time with this track.

The next track is [Kiwi wa Boku ni Niteiru by See-Saw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6BkF23UPbM), which is an excellent song to test the ability of an IEM to handle female vocals in "weeb musics." An IEM with ideal tonal balance should be able to make the voice of Chiaki Ishikawa bright and clear, while maintaining enough energy in the lower midrange to avoid making the voice thin and harsh (a common problem with many IEMs with too much upper midrange boost). Here are key observations about how Todi performs with this track:
- The voice of Chiaki Ishikawa lacks a bit of shine and sits further back in the mix. 
- On the plus side, her voice does not sound unnatural with Todi. 

The next track is [Now We Are Free by 2CELLOS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74CYIdYoQ5w), which assesses an IEM's ability to render lower-midrange, particularly cellos. An IEM with ideal tonal balance should render cellos with a thick and authoritative tone and be able to reproduce the low pitch resonance and "rumble" of the cello body. At the same time, it must avoid cutting the upper midrange and treble to the point of making the cellos sound muffled, muddy, or lacking clear articulation. Here are key observations about how Todi performs with this track:
- The cellos dominate the mix, overshadows the rest of the orchestra and higher pitched violins
- The cellos sound a bit boomy and lack the texture and "grip" that I expect, likely due to the lack of upper midrange.
- On the plus side, bass sounds thumpy and satisfying. 

The next track is [Playing God by Polyphia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5NoQg8LdDk). I focus on the tonal quality and the level of energy conveyed by the guitars. This track also helps assess the balance of the bass against the midrange, which is reflected by the relative loudness between the bass guitar and the rest of the music. Here are key observations about how Todi performs with this track:
- Todi works very well with this track.
- Guitar plucks and picks sound crisp and clean
- Cymbals and hats are highlighted
- Kick drums and bass guitar are also highlighted. I can easily hear the bass line and feel every bass kick.

The next track on our list is the aria of [Bach's Goldberg Variations, recorded by Lang Lang](https://youtu.be/linQUK6jNmg?si=v_2nz6exiNXsZUjU). I find that piano is the best instrument to assess the overall tonal balance of an IEM. Simply put, if the piano does not sound even across the frequencies, the midrange of an IEM is imbalanced. Here are key observations about how Todi performs with this track:
- Surprisingly, the unique tonal balance of Todi does not make the piano sounds imbalance with this track
- The bass casts a linger low-pitched hum on the rest of the recording in a way that is quite pleasant
- This track also showcases the upper treble extension of Todi, evidenced by the prominent reproduction of the lingering reverberation in the track. The reverberation is not overdone or distracting, but I didn't need to pay special attention to pick out. The detail of the reverberation is quite good. 

The next track on our list is [Ciaccona from Bach's Violin Partita No.2 in D Minor, performed by Kavakos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtA5DbswJ90). This track aims to assess two aspects: the rendition of violin and the reproduction of upper treble energy, which is reflected by the quality and detail of the reverberation and micro details at the decay end of violin notes. Here are key observations about how Todi performs with this track:
- Again, surprisingly, the unique tonal balance of Todi does not make the violin sounds wrong in this track
- The bass and treble emphasis actually works well with this track. 
- Again, this track showcases the upper treble extension of Todi via excellent but not overdone reproduction of reverberation. 

The final track on our timbre test is [Synchro BOM-BA-YE by Tokyo Kosei Wind Orchestra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lwPiXnOGZ4). This track aims to test the tonal balance and timbre of the upper midrange and treble region. There are two cues I focus on in this track: the hand claps at the beginning, and the tonal quality of all brass instruments throughout the track. Here are key observations about how Todi performs with this track:
- The hand claps at the beginning of the track sounds natural with good detail, meaning the balance between different parts of the treble is quite good. 
- The lower brass instruments are more present than the higher brass instruments.
- The higher brass instruments lack a shine, possibly due to the subdued upper midrange frequencies and the stronger emphasise on the lower frequencies. 



**Bass and perceived dynamic:**

Overview of the bass and dynamic using the soundwheel terminology:
- Attack
- Bass precision
- Punch
- Powerful

Bass is a highlight of Todi's performance. 

Let's examine the bass and perceived dynamics of Todi with some test tracks. The first one is [A Reckoning in Blood from The Ghost of Tsushima OST](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaBMXXo-vdU). I'll focus on the crescendo at 01:10, which an ideal dynamic IEM should effectively communicate. Additionally, the beats from 02:50 need to be strong, snappy, and precise, requiring excellent control across the entire frequency range. Here are key observations about how Todi performs with this track:
- The bass feels powerful.
- The energy of the bass hits focuses more on the attack of the bass note rather than the subbass rumble
- The bass attack is not laser sharp like BA woofers. Still, the attacks are powerful enough to create a "slam" sensation.
- The bass has good sense of texture and details, though I think the texture and detail of the bassline are some what limited by the tuning. 

The next track is [Strength of a Thousand Men (Live) by Two Steps from Hell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POmTXTBtRZA). I'll pay attention to the quality bass accompanying each beat. An IEM with perfect bass handling should convey a sense of "grippiness" and texture in the bass region, making the bass line growl rather than low-pitched hum. Lastly, every beat must be snappy and incisive to capture the marching energy of this track. Here are key observations about how Todi performs with this track:
- The bass feels very grippy, controlled, and textured.
- Todi has no problem keeping up with the fast bass line. The bassline of this track does not feel blurry like the case with most IEMs when dealing with this track.

**Resolution:** *To me, "resolution" can be broken down into three components: (1) Sharpness, incisiveness, or "definition" of note attacks (see the figure above). (2) The separation of instruments and vocals, especially when they overlap on the soundstage. (3) The texture and details in the decay side of the notes. The first two give music clarity and make it easy to track individual elements of a mix. The last provides music details and nuances.*

![](/assets/images/resolution.jpg)

Describe the resolution using the terminology from soundwheel:
- Clean
- Presence
- Clarity
- Detailed
- Natural

Todi has quite solid resolution. However, the tuning might not showcase this capability clearly.

Let's elaborate on the resolution of Todi with some test tracks. For the first track, we again listen to [Ciaccona from Bach's Violin Partita No. 2 in D Minor, performed by Kavakos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtA5DbswJ90). I focus on the micro details such as the bow catching the strings. I also focus on the quality and nuances of the reverberation and decays of the notes. Here are key observations about how Todi performs with this track and how it compares against other reference IEMs:
- Todi showcases quite good ability to resolve details in this track. It captures smallest details like the breath and the reverberation of the concert hall.
- The violin strings sound dry, crisp, and realistic.
- The only limitation I can hear is that the micro texture in the sound of violin itself, such as the articulation of the bow and the slight scratch that the bow hair makes against the violin strings are not highlighted. I need to pay carefully attention to find that information. It means that Todi is capable of resolving these details, but the tuning does not highlight them. 

The next track is the "controlled chaos" [ABC feat. Sophia Black by Polyphia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mtd24QIBJ5Y). With this track, I focus on an IEM's ability to not crumble under the complexity of overlapping layers in the mix. An IEM with ideal resolution would make it easy for me to hear everything, down to the very faint overdub by Sophia Black on the side channels right from the opening of the track. Here are key observations about how Todi performs with this track and how it compares against other reference IEMs:
- I'm surprised by how composed Todi is when handling this busy track. It was quite easy to pick out the faint overdubs on the sides of the stage.
- Even in busy sections when the lower midrange somewhat overpower the rest of the mix, I was still able to pick out and follow individual elements in the mix, as they are well separated. When they are placed near each other on the soundstage, they are layered up rather than mushed together. 

**Stereo imaging and soundstage:** *Stereo imaging or "soundstage" is a psychoacoustic illusion that different recording elements appear at various locations inside and around your head. Your brain creates based on the cues in the recording, which are enhanced or diminushed by your IEMs, your DAC, and your amplifier. In rare cases, with some specific songs, some IEMs can trick you into thinking that the sound comes from the environment (a.k.a., "holographic")*

![](/assets/images/soundstage.png)

Overview of the soundstage and imaging capability using the soundwheel terminology.:
- Spatial extent: depth, width, envelopment
- Localiation: distance, internality, localisability
- Reverberation

Todi does not expand wide to the sides of the stage, but it has quite good illusion of depth, particularly the contrast between foreground and background.

Let's listen to some test tracks to assess the soundstage and imaging capability of Todi. The first one is [Original Sound Effect Track - Memory from Gundam Seed Destiny OST album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhJWAWqExQs). This track compiles all sound effects used in the show, arranged atmospherically and immersively. An IEM with ideal soundstage and imaging should effectively utilize this information to create a diverse soundstage, with sound elements appearing in all three dimensions, offering contrast between near and distant sounds. Many elements on the left and right channels will seem to originate outside the ears. Here are key observations about how Todi performs with this track and how it compares against other reference IEMs:
- The stage does not expands to the sides as much as I would wanted. 
- Most of the actions on the soundstage are concentrated to the center of the soundstage. 
- However, Todi does an excellent at conveying the contrast between closer and further sound elements, which in turn creates an interesting illusion of depth.
- The background elements of the soundstage can appear to come from outside the headstage.
- Overall, the soundstage constructed by Todi is somewhat intimate, but quite immersive and interesting. 

The next track is [Shadow of Baar Dau](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXcLuLQ_5oM). This one tests an IEM's ability to convincingly convey the sense of distance of background elements, such as the string section at 00:20 on the front left and the vocal chants on the front right at 00:40. An IEM with perfect soundstage and imaging should make this track feel spacious, creating an illusion that some background elements originate outside the head. In essence, it should provide a fully immersive listening experience. Here are key observations about how Todi performs with this track and how it compares against other reference IEMs:
- Again, Todi showcases an interesting illusion of depth, thanks to the strong contrast between foreground (near) and background (faraway) elements in the mix.
- I like how the vocals on the side of the stage seem to come from the side-front, outside the head.
- Unfortunately, majority of the action on the soundstage still concentrate at the center, giving a more boxed in and intimate presentation.

Driveability
===

Todi is not easy to drive. Even with 4.4mm output, I still need to turn the volume of my K7 amplifier higher than average. 

I also hear more refined bass response and less crowded soundstage when moving from small DAP like R3II to devices with more powerful amplifier like DX300 and K7.

Conclusions
===

I'm conflicted about this IEM on many aspects:
- I appreciate how they try a different tuning. At the same time, I'm not quite sure that I jive with this tuning. I think it limits this IEM. 
- Eventhough I don't jive with the tuning, I can't deny that the tuning gives Todi a unique vibe that grew on me after a few listening sessions.

At the end of the day, I think Todi is an interesting boutique IEM. It's interesting, it's different, and it's capable. Niche recommendation.

**What I like about this IEM:**

- 

**What could be improved:**

- 

**Absolute Sonic Quality Rating:** 5/5 - Outstanding

**Bias Score:** 5/5 - I love this IEM!
