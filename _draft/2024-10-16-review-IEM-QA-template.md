- What I look for in an IEM is **immersion.** I want to feel the orchestra around my head, track individual instruments, and hear all of their textures and details. I'm not picky about tonality, as long as it does not make the orchestra, violin, cellos, and pianos sound wrong.
- I rate IEMs within with a consistent scale from **1 (Poor) to 3 (Good) to 5 (Outstanding)**. An overall ranking of 3/5 or above is considered positive. 
- Ranking list and measurement database are on [my IEM review blog](https://iegems.nk-tran.com/).
- The terminology for subjective impressions in this review is based on the Audio Wheel for reproduced sound defined in the technical report [ITU-R BS.2399-0](https://www.itu.int/pub/R-REP-BS.2399)
- **This review is based on a review sample from XXXX (Thank you!).** I have no affiliation with or financial interest in XXXX. 
- **This review is possible thanks to the Australian tour arranged by XXXX and @Damz87 (Thank you!)**. I have no affiliation with or financial interest in XXXX. 
- **This review is possible thanks to the review tour arranged by Audio Geek Australia group and XXXX (Thank you!)**. I have no affiliation with or financial interest in XXXX.

The subjective impression is captured using the lexicon in the Sound Wheel below. I'll clarify the terminology as I use them. If you want to see more details of the lexicon and related reference, please have a look at the technical report [ITU-R BS.2399-0](https://www.itu.int/pub/R-REP-BS.2399).

**Timbre:**  *It is helpful to think of an IEM as a filter that sits between the incoming audio signal and your ear drums. This filter makes some parts of the signal (frequencies) louder whilst other parts quieter. This effect can be measured objectively by the squiggly lines below, called Frequency Response (FR) graphs, which measure how loud an IEM is at different frequencies from 20Hz (bass) to 20kHz (upper treble).  Ideally, an IEM should change the signal as least as possible (a.k.a., "flat tuning") to avoid disturbing the balance between fundamental frequencies of instruments and their harmonics to ensure that they sound natural and life-like. Practically, IEM engineers can tune or "voice" an IEM to deviate carefully from the flat tuning to create interesting colouring and effects on the audio content. This voicing or tonal balance of an IEM can be denoted as its sound signature. Subjectivity is how your ears and brain interpret such sound signature and decide whether it is "enjoyable"*

*Figure shows the frequency response of XXXX against the Harman in-ear target. Measurements were done with an IEC-711-compliant coupler and might only be compared with other measurements from this same coupler. Above 8kHz, the measurement likely does not match the response at the ear drum. Visit my [graph database](https://nk-tran.com/iegems-graphtool/) for more comparisons.*

Overview of the timbre and tonal balance, with reference to the frequency response. Use the terminology of sound wheel.
- Timbral balance: dark-bright, full, homogeneous
- Midrange: nasal? canny? strength?
- Treble: brilliance, tinny? treble strength?
- Bass: bass strength? depth? boomy? boxy?

*How do you describe the overall sound signature of XXXX?* 

*How does XXXX balance different voices and instruments in a band? (Sample tracks: [ABC feat. Sophia Black by Polyphia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mtd24QIBJ5Y))*

*How does XXXX balance different parts of a piano? (Sample tracks: [Bach's Goldberg Variations, recorded by Lang Lang](https://youtu.be/linQUK6jNmg?si=v_2nz6exiNXsZUjU))*

*How does the midrange of XXXX handle vocals? (Sample tracks: [Dreamland Express by John Denver](https://youtu.be/6pqfoBUTFdk?si=oxKzIDQ42CfgCyuf), [Kiwi wa Boku ni Niteiru by See-Saw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6BkF23UPbM))*

*How does XXXX handle sibilant recordings? (Sample tracks: [Shivers by Ed Sheeran](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2_Lrg6rRks))*

*How does XXXX reproduce strings and orchestra? (Sample tracks: [Now We Are Free by 2CELLOS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74CYIdYoQ5w), [Ciaccona from Bach's Violin Partita No.2 in D Minor, performed by Kavakos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtA5DbswJ90), [Synchro BOM-BA-YE by Tokyo Kosei Wind Orchestra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lwPiXnOGZ4))*


**Percussion, Bass, and perceived dynamic:** *In this section, my focus is the not just the bass, but rather the sense of dynamic of an IEM. Can it convey the sense of beat and rhythm? Can it reproduce transients, the fast and large jump of loudness in the music? Simply put, is this IEM toe-tapping? Creating this energy requires all parts of the frequency spectrum working together: treble energy around 4-6kHz conveys snappy attacks of stick hitting percussive instruments at the beginning of a beat, bass energy around 150Hz conveys the punchy sensation of the beat itself, whilst the subbass energy below 60Hz creates the physical rumble sensation that convey power and atmosphere. Weak treble response dulls the attacks. Weak bass makes beats hollow. Too much bass makes bassline blurry and dulls the sense of rhythm. Thus, "dynamic IEM" is a balancing art.*

Overview of the bass and dynamic using the soundwheel terminology:
- Attack
- Bass precision
- Punch
- Powerful

*How does XXXX convey "epic" bass lines? (Sample tracks: [Heart of Courage (Live) by Two Steps From Hell](https://youtu.be/1Qvp-w24z1U?si=44knlswJcyf7Ez2z), [A Reckoning in Blood from The Ghost of Tsushima OST](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaBMXXo-vdU))*

*How does XXXX handle a drum kit and bass guitar? (Sample tracks: [Playing God by Polyphia](https://youtu.be/Z5NoQg8LdDk?si=eEQGevLZb1SE-FVY))*

*In conclusion, is XXXX ... toe-tapping?*


**Resolution:** *To me, "resolution" can be broken down into three components: (1) Sharpness, incisiveness, or "definition" of note attacks (see the figure below). (2) The separation of instruments and vocals, especially when they overlap on the soundstage. (3) The texture and details in the decay side of the notes. The first two give music clarity and make it easy to track individual elements of a mix. The last provides music details and nuances. Whilst IEMs can "force" clarity by boosting treble to unnatural level, it might still lack resolution as it cannot "peel apart" complex tracks with overlapping instruments*

Describe the resolution using the terminology from soundwheel:
- Clean
- Presence
- Clarity
- Detailed
- Natural

*Can XXXX handle complex, overlapping recordings? (Sample tracks: [ABC feat. Sophia Black by Polyphia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mtd24QIBJ5Y))*

*Can XXXX handle recordings with congested lower frequencies? (Sample tracks: [Now We Are Free performed by 2CELLOS](https://youtu.be/74CYIdYoQ5w?si=QcKrIFSifRzBHt2i))*

*How does XXXX convey micro details? (Sample tracks: [Ciaccona from Bach's Violin Partita No. 2 in D Minor, performed by Kavakos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtA5DbswJ90))*

*On the scale from fair (Moondrop Aria) to good (Moondrop Blessing 2) to great (CFA Andromeda 2020) to outstanding (AFUL Cantor), how resolving is XXXX?*


**Stereo imaging and soundstage:** *Stereo imaging or "soundstage" is a psychoacoustic illusion that different recording elements appear at various locations inside and around your head. Your brain creates based on the cues in the recording, which are enhanced or diminushed by your IEMs, your DAC, and your amplifier. In rare cases, with some specific songs, some IEMs can trick you into thinking that the sound comes from the environment (a.k.a., "holographic")*

![](/assets/images/soundstage.png)

Overview of the soundstage and imaging capability using the soundwheel terminology.:
- Spatial extent: depth, width, envelopment
- Localiation: distance, internality, localisability
- Reverberation

*How does XXXX position instruments in a complex, 3D-sounding recording? (Sample tracks: [Original Sound Effect Track - Memory from Gundam Seed Destiny OST album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhJWAWqExQs))*

*How does XXXX convey a sense of space in spacious recordings? (Sample tracks: [Shadow of Baar Dau](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXcLuLQ_5oM))*

*How does XXXX handles sound positioning in FPS games?*

*On the scale from good (Blessing 2) to great (CFA Andromeda 2020) to outstanding (AFUL Cantor), how good is the stereo imaging and soundstage of XXXX?*
