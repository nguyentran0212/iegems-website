> tl;dr: The best description of Titan S is that it sounds right: timbre is realistic, frequency response is not too warm nor cold, separation and micro-dynamic are adequate, drums are adequately tactile and snappy. The key limitation is that it does not sound special: no extreme detail, no exaggerated soundstage, no epic bass. Still, it represents great value and an excellent beginning of an IEM journey.

# Preample

- I purchase this unit on my own. I have no affiliation with or financial interest in Dunu.
- All listening tests were conducted at a around 65 db. 
- My music library covers nostalgic pop music, epic orchestral music from Sci-fi shows, classical violin performances, piano, lo-fi beats, and a few rock songs.
- What I look for in IEM, in order of importance: strong sense of depth with elements in a mix layering from closer to further away, clear separation between elements, detailed and textured elements, snappy and tactile note attacks in bass and midrange, natural timbre. 
- IEMs are rated with a series of A/B tests against a few benchmark IEMs. The total rating is the average of component ratings. EQ is NOT used in these tests. See the [methodology](/methodology) for more detail. 
- Eartips can change the insertion depth of an IEM, which in turns changes its soundstage and frequency response. I try to insert IEMs such that they rest against the concha of my ears. 

# Non-sound aspects

Dunu announces Titan S by the end of 2021. It seems to replace the Dunu DM-480 as the most budget-friendly option in their current line up. Titan S is equipped with a single 11mm dynamic driver. Unfortunately, it does not use the ECLIPSÆŽ technology featured in other DD IEM from Dunu such as Luna, Zen, and Falcon Pro.  

Titan S comes with a lot of accessories: 
- 10 pairs of ear tips: they have different height, which can change the distance between the IEM and your ear and impact the soundstage.
- Canvas carrying case: good quality, but quite flat. You have to be careful when putting the IEMs in because their nozzles might prevent closing the case.
- 2-pin cable: *very* soft and well-behaved. The 2-pin side matches the design of the IEMs, so changing cable might not be a good idea.

Design-wise, Titan S has a unique look. However, it does not look as good in real-life as in 3D renders: angles are not as defined, the ridges of the IEM and the cable do not match exactly, and there is a seam line going down on the side of the IEM. On the plus side, the metal seems to be strong and does not use any paint, thus chipping and bubbling might not be an issue. 

Fit-wise, Titan S has at least three insertion depth due to having long nozzles. The blue eartips give you the shallowest insertion with the IEMs resting at the outer edge of your ear canal. The red eartips allow for a medium insertion depth. The small white eartips allow for deep insertion similarly to Etymotic IEMs. In this position, Titan S rest against the concha of my ears. These three configurations have noticeable sonic differences. The deeper your fit is, the more clarity and detail you get at the expense of soundstage. In this review, I use the medium insertion depth. 

# Sound Analysis

## Percussion Control

> **Percussion control** reflects an IEM's ability to render drums and other instruments tha maintain rhythm and tempo of a mix. IEMs with good percussion control can keep up with fast and complex rhythm without blurring the beats together. IEMs with excellent percussion control also gives a tactile "snap" to percussion attacks. Percussion control is determined by both bass and treble tuning. 

Song list:
- 

A strength of Titan S is the way it renders percussion instruments. It does not mean that Titan S has loud bass. Instead, it offers the right ratio of subbass (rumble), midbass (punch), and treble around 4-6k (attack) to make drum hits snappy and energetic yet clean. It has no trouble keeping with the chaotic sections from 1:10 to 1:35 in MS Gundam: Iron-blooded Orphans and 0:40 to 1:05 in INFINITY. Both the low-end the the high-end percussion hits remain distinctive and rhythmic with minimal mushiness.

Comparing to the benchmark IEMs:
- Titan S renders percussion instruments similarly to ER2SE, but louder and a bit more tactile, meaning you feel the hits in your ear drums more.
- Titan S renders drum hits cleaner and snappier than Aria. As a result, it remains more composed in difficult percussion sections.
- Titan S is one step behind FD5 in terms of energy and physical impact of percussion instruments.

## Detail, Texture, and Micro-contrast

> **Detail, Texture, and Micro-contrast** reflect an IEM's ability to reveal fine details in a mix. IEMs with good detail retrieval render background elements such as the backing vocal, string ensemble in the background, and reverbs clearly. They also reveal more micro contrast and little vibrations in the trailing end of notes.



## Separation and Layering

> **Separation and layering** reflects an IEM's ability to render elements in a mix distinctively. IEMs with excellent separation and layering can separate elements from left to right as well as from front to back.

## Spatial Illusion

> **Spatial illusion** reflects an IEM's ability to construct an imaginary sound field around a listener's head. IEMs with excellent spatial illusion create a dome-like and open soundstage around listener's head.

## Tonality

> **Tonality** reflects the timbre and relative loudness of different elements in a mix. I assess IEM's tonality based on how bad they are rather than how good they are. As long as the tuning does not make timbre unrealistic nor reduce technical performance significantly, it is acceptable.
