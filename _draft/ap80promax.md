# General information about this device

AP80 Pro Max is a micro DAP. I use the term micro DAP to denote the class of DAP that is very pocketable and run a Linux-based OS rather than usual Android based. They are simpler and focus exclusively on audio playback rather than multimedia like their Android counterpart.

AP80 Pro Max is a product of a collaboration between two companies: Hidizs (well known for DAP, DAC, and have been making some good IEMs recently) and Linsoul (the big audio retailer)

It is the updated version of the older DAP from Hidizs called AP80 Pro X.

# Packaing and accessories:

Very compact cardboard box.

Inside, there is a greeting card co-signed by Hidizs and Linsoul.

Under the card, you find the DAP itself. Device comes with screen protector pre-applied

There is a USB-A to USB-C cable and a shorter USB-C to USB-C cable included in the box.




# Functionality

This DAP can do a lot of things:
- Lossless music playback of local files on SD card
- Digital output via USB to an external DAC
- Acting as an external USB DAC for another phone or laptop
- Streaming music from Tidal and Qobus directly with onboard 2.4 Ghz Wifi
- Bluetooth transmitter (sending bluetooth audio from onboard lossless playback or wifi streaming to wireless earbuds)
- Bluetooth receiver (receiving audio signal from phone or laptop via bluetooth)
- Receiving audio content from phone or computer via AirPlay and DLNA




# Impressions and usage experience

I have been using this device for nearly a month before writing this review.

My use cases:
- Put in pocket for local music playback on commute
- Use as a USB DAC for my desktop PC at office for background music
- Use as bluetooth receiver for my phone for watching youTube at night

I find the device well built and nice looking. I like the sharp CNC machined geometric design on the frame.

It's surprisingly small. The online photo does not quite convey how small this device is. It is quite a bit smaller than other micro DAPs devices currently on the market. 

It's light, small, easy to carry or throw in the bag. 

The change from 2.5mm connector of the older AP80 Pro X to the 4.4mm connect is a very welcome change, as most of my cables have 4.4mm jack.

I find the screen to be slightly washed out, low contrast, but serve the purpose well. I mostly turn off the screen after selecting the song, so it's not that big of a deal.

The overall software experience is usable, not bad or slow, just not as fast and snappy as an average phone.

The software experience is familiar, as it runs the same new version of HiByOS that is common across these micro DAP devices. My sample lacks the MSEB and parametric EQ (PEQ), which is a shame. But Hidizs has confirmed that the firmware version on my sample was outdated. The full production unit will have MSEB, PEQ, and normal 10 band graphical EQ, meaning you have access to a full suite of sound shaping options for your listening experience.

Bluetooth software is a bit better than the previous AP80 Pro X in the sense that when I connect it to my phone, it automatically connects correctly to LDAC rather than incorrectly connect to the inferior SBC. 

However, latency is still still not good with both wireless and wired connection (via USB). There is a noticeable delay between audio and video. Even lip sync in normal videos are impacted. If I watch an orchestra, I will see that the orchestra lags behind the conductor.

Sonic-wise, my impression remains unchanged from the initial impressions. This DAP sounds clear and focused. However, at the same time, it lacks the sense of space and dimention. Most of the time, the sound elements in a mix tend to distribute close to the phantom center of the soundstage in the head, making the soundstage rather small. Yes, even though some background elements such as distant choral section or string section or background ambience can still sound properly distant, before the foregroud is tightly focused inside the head, the stage always feels smaller than how I am used to with other DAPs and DACs. As someone who listens to a lot of orchestral soundtracks that require a sense of space and scale, I find this aspect of AP80 Pro Max rather disappointing. Your experience might be better if you listen to more vocal centric music and you prefer everything to be close, and the sense of space and ambience do not contribute significantly to the enjoyment of the recording.

Similar story with the bass: note attacks can sound tight and relatively impactful, it lacks the sense power and resonance that I expect. 

These sonic impressions come from comparisons against the "average" sound that I hear from the same IEMs and same familiar tracks across a variety of DAPs and DACs that I'm familiar with and use as reference. (So, it's not just like AP80 Pro Max vs certain DAP, but against how other DAPs and DACs can generally do with the same IEM and same recording).

Overall, I think AP80 Pro Max is utilitarian, it's convenience, and it's multi functional. 

Though it's not particularly inspiring, sonic wise. In this regard, it's very similar to its predescessor, the AP80 Pro X. Fortunate for AP80 Pro Max, it does a better job than its predescessor, on all aspects, from software to sound quality.


## more details from early overall impressions across many topics

I just picked up this new DAP earlier today. It’s a direct upgrade to the aging AP80 Pro X, the first DAP I ever owned and reviewed. My sample comes with a nice blue colour scheme. Hidizs also sent the leather case as an extra accessories.

First and foremost, this device is so cute. It does not look that small on Internet, but it’s tiny in real life. Shorter, narrower, and thinner than micro DAPs I reviewed this year.

The connection has also been upgraded. We finally have 4.4mm rather than 2.5mm balanced output. (If you primarily use 2.5, RIP, I guess?)

Software feels familiar. It seems to be based on a version of Hiby OS, but the MSEB is not there anymore. The graphical EQ is, fortunately, still there, albeit hidden in a tiny menu that is easy to miss. You can also stream tidal and qobuz with this device.

Battery drops faster than I expect. For example, half way through first moment of Mendelssohn violin concerto in E minor and I already lost 2%. Of course, it’s likely that the power meter in these low cost SoC is as blind as a bat, so that number might not be correct. (Not to fault Hidizs here. My retro handheld running on H700 SoC are also blind as bat when it comes to battery reading).

Sound wise, I say it’s pretty much ESS sound with Hidizs DAP tuning. It’s clear, transparent, and luckily not harsh or piercing. It pulls as much details as I expected from Dawn X and my classical recordings. However, the sound is quite tightly distributed in the center rather than spreading out. Kinda like when you listen to a Moondrop IEM and find that the mix is heavily focused in the center point somewhere in your skull, with the background radiating outward. That’s how this DAP sound to me.

Dynamic is good. Bass can punch when needed. However, bass also feels more “tidy” than what I usually hear.

Essentially, clean as a whistle, and tight. Your preference and IEM would determine whether this is a good option for you. 


# Selected comparisons

I compared across a variety of tracks, but for the sake of description, I will focus on "Requiem for Attack on Titan" by Grissiniproject, recorded at Stockholm Concert Hall. I use balanced output on all devices. I use AFUL Performer 5+2 as the test IEM to represent an "average" IEM.

## Vs Hidizs XO

On paper, AP80 Pro Max should be the DAP version of the Hidizs XO DAC, given that they use the same DAC chips. However, the sound they convey is quite different in practice. 

I found that XO has a larger sonic presentation. Given the same orchestral recording, the soundstage feels smaller, as if most actions happen "inside the skull" and rarely expands beyond the headstage with AP80 Pro Max. Meanwhile, the stage feels definitely more spread out, and thus orchestral recording feels more "epic" with XO.

The tonality of XO also feels more "U-shaped" than AP80 Pro Max in the sense that the midrange feels like it takes a small step back, and treble is more emphasised. Meanwhile, AP80 Pro Max feels more midrange focused, more focused.

Other technical aspects like dynamic and resolution have negligible differences.

## Vs AP80 Pro X

AP80 Pro Max is an upgrade version of AP80 Pro X. 

Simply put, these devices have very similar sound signature, but AP80 Pro Max has better performance across the board in terms of sound quality. It's more detailed, the sound has more nuances and depth, the stage feels a bit larger and better perception of depth and layering. 



# My parting thoughts and assessment

I think the value of the device lies in its portability and convenience, and lower price vs other micro DAPs in its class. It's very small, so easy to bring with you. It provides various functionality to address your audio needs throughout the day. The price is low, as I mentioned, especially in at the early bird price. I find the design is also rather nice to look and feel. 

However, the sound of the onboard audio circuitry is not particularly inspiring, though perfectly serviceable and a step up from the previous version. That said, this DAP does have a different sound and presentation than the usual DACs in 2024, 2025, that use on Cirrus Logic DAC chips, so you might find this sound signature appealing. 

Who this device is for? I think if you have set aside a budget of around $100 for a USB DAC, you can extend the budget a bit to get one of these DAPs to gain more functionality. Another kind of user who benefits from AP80 Pro Max is someone who needs an audio source to play lossless FLAC file or receive USB signal to output to an external DAC or amplifier.
