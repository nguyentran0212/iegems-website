> tl;dr: An average yet hard to beat performer. It is relaxing and warm, but also a bit fuzzy, mushy, especially in the bass. However, you wouldn't recognize these problems unless you have listened to outright better ones, and those wouldn't cost the same as Aria. 

# Technical Specs

- Driver: 1 DD
- Socket : recessed 0.78 mm pin
- Sensitivity : 122 dB/Vrms (@1kHz)
- Impedance : 32 ohm +or- 15% (@1kHz) 

# How good is it as a daily driver?

# Sound Analysis

This review was conducted using the [Subjective Benchmark-based Method](/methodology). 

> tl;dr: IEMs are rated by comparing against well-known and well-performing IEMs (Aria, Blessing 2, ER2SE) on bass control, detail, separation and layering, spatial, and tonality. Differences between IEMs with the same score is negligible, so get whichever cheaper and ships faster.

## Bass Control

> **Bass Control** is about the quality of bass, not how loud it is (quantity). Well-controlled bass hits fast, hard, and maintains precise timing regardless of how busy the bass line becomes.

## Detail

> **Detail Retrieval** reflects an IEM's ability to reveal fine details in a mix. IEMs with great detail give voices and instruments texture and nuance. They also show more elements such as the backing vocal, string ensemble in the background, and reverbs.

## Separation and Layering

## Tonality

> **Tonality** reflects the timbre and relative loudness of different elements in a mix. I assess IEM's tonality based on how bad they are rather than how good they are. As long as the tuning does not make timbre unrealistic nor reduce technical performance significantly, it is okay.
